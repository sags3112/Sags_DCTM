How do I set up a new locale for Webtop to support another language?


Webtop comes installed with US English language support by default. You can obtain Language packs for support in the following languages: 

1. French 
2. German 
3. Italian 
4. Japanese 
5. Korean 
6. Spanish 

For other languages, qualified international Documentum partners can use the "Localization Kit" to create their own language packs. At this time, Webtop does not support languages that are written right-to-left. 

The procedure for creating and registering a new locale is outlined in the Chapter 4 of the Configuring Documentum Webtop (pdf) document. Basically, create a set of translated JAVA properties files for each of the Webtop and WDK which will be present a UI to the user. Add this new locale to the custom/app.xml file for your new locale to show up in the login options in Webtop. 

Basic Steps are as follows: 

Translate the NLS Properties Files 

All of the NLS Properties files are located in the strings folder in each application folder. While translating your strings for a new locale, you must create new files and folders for your new locale in the custom/strings folder. 

To create a new locale: 

1. Copy all of the NLS files, maintaining the directory structure, from a Documentum-supplied locale in the Webtop folder into the custom/strings folder. 

2. Copy all of the additional files (not contained in the webtop/strings folder) from the same locale in the webcomponent layer into the same custom/strings folder. 

3. Copy all of the additional files (not contained in the webtop/strings and webcomponent/strings folder) from the same locale in the in the wdk layer into the same custom/strings folder. 

4. Rename all of the NLS files according to the following convention: 
<NLS File Name>_<language code>_<country code> where: 

<NLS File Name> is the file name from the Documentum-supplied locale. 
<language code> is the appropriate language code taken from ISO 639. 
<country code> is the appropriate country code taken from ISO 3166. 

For example, for a Portuguese locale rename the TabBarNlsProp.properties file to TabBarNlsProp_pt_PT.properties. 

5. Translate all of the strings in the NLS files for the new locale. 

After creating all of the necessary files for a locale, you must add the locale to Webtop. 

Copy the entire <language> section from ../webtop/wdk/app.xml to ../webtop/custom/app.xml and add you new locale. In this case: <locale>pt_PT</locale>, and set the new default locale if you want. 

<language> 
<!-- List of Locales supported by this application --> 
<supported_locales> 
<locale>en_EN</locale> 
<locale>fr_FR</locale> 
<locale>de_DE</locale> 
<locale>it_IT</locale> 
<locale>es_ES</locale> 
<locale>ja_JP</locale> 
<locale>ko_KR</locale> 
<locale>pt_PT</locale> 
</supported_locales> 

<!-- Default Locale --> 
<default_locale>pt_PT</default_locale> 
</language> 

Note: It is important to remember that inheritance occurs only at the <language> primary element level. Therefore, you must copy the whole section from the /wdk/app.xml file into the /custom/app.xml file.
