How to add en_GB locale to repository

Symptoms

You are seeing some locale error message, such as "[DM_QUERY2_E_INVALID_LOCALE_SETTING]" and "The session_locale setting of 'en_GB' in the sessionconfig object is not a valid locale in the docbase".



Cause

This issue is caused by the WDK application default locale setting. 

For example, user changed the default locale from en_US to en_GB for an English version of WDK application due to displaying the right format of date time. 

As there is no data dictionary for the certain locale and the application hits error when user perform a locale sensitive operation.



Resolution

The following is the steps you need to take for adding en_GB to the repository.



1. Prepare the data dictionary information.

• Go to the $DOCUMENTUM\product\<version>\bin directory.
• Copy the data_dictionary_en.txt file and rename it as data_dictionary_en_GB.txt.
• Edit data_dictionary_en_GB.txt

          Change the LOCALE statement to LOCALE = en_GB.
• Modify the data dictionary initialisation file $DOCUMENTUM\dba\config\<repository_name>\data_dictionary.ini 

         Add the en_GB locale file to the [NLS_FILES] section;

                eg. add  data_dictionary_en_GB.txt





2. Populate en_GB Data Dictionary
• Go to the $DOCUMENTUM\product\<version>\bin directory.
• Enter the following command line at the operating system prompt:

dmbasic -f dd_populate.ebs -e Entry_Point -- <repository_name> <username> <password> <ini_filename>



ini_filename is the name of the initialization file that contains the data files. This can be a full path specification or only the file name. If you include just the file name, the file must be in the same directory as the population script.

eg.

dmbasic -f dd_populate.ebs -e Entry_Point -- <repository_name> <username> <password> C:\Documentum\dba\config\<docbase>\data_dictionary.ini



3. Then run the data dictionary publishing job
