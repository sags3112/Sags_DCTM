Use this query to see which jobs are eligible to run right now:

 

SELECT ALL r_object_id, object_name, a_next_invocation FROM dm_job WHERE ( (run_now = 1) OR ((is_inactive = 0) AND ( ( a_next_invocation <= DATE('now') AND a_next_invocation IS NOT NULLDATE ) OR ( a_next_continuation <= DATE('now') AND a_next_continuation IS NOT NULLDATE ) ) AND ((expiration_date > DATE('now')) OR (expiration_date IS NULLDATE)) AND ((max_iterations = 0) OR (a_iterations < max_iterations))) ) AND (i_is_reference = 0 OR i_is_reference is NULL) AND (i_is_replica = 0 OR i_is_replica is NULL) ORDER BY a_next_invocation, r_object_id

 

Use this query to see which jobs are eligible to be run right now, as well as what jobs are eligible to be run at a future date:

 

SELECT ALL r_object_id, object_name, a_next_invocation FROM dm_job WHERE ( (run_now = 1) OR ((is_inactive = 0) AND ( ( a_next_invocation IS NOT NULLDATE ) OR (  a_next_continuation IS NOT NULLDATE ) ) AND ((expiration_date > DATE('now')) OR (expiration_date IS NULLDATE)) AND ((max_iterations = 0) OR (a_iterations < max_iterations))) ) AND (i_is_reference = 0 OR i_is_reference is NULL) AND (i_is_replica = 0 OR i_is_replica is NULL) ORDER BY a_next_invocation, r_object_id



List of reasons why a job can be considered invalid:

The job may have no method name specified.
The start date of the job is set to null or is not formed correctly.
The start date of the job is before the year 1970.
The next invocation date of the job is null or is not formed correctly.
The next invocation date of the job is before the year 1970.
The expiration date of the job is not formed correctly.
The expiration date of the job is before the year 1970 or is later than the start date.
The max iterations of the job is set to a number less than 0.
The run_mode and run_interval values for the job object conflict. For example, if run_mode is set to be a specific day of the month (run_mode = 8) and run_interval is set to 33.
