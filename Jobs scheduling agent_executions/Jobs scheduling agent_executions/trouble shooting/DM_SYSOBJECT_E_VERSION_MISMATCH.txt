sHello Team,

Any idea why we see the below 2 errors for the Job "dm_DataDictionaryPublisher

Job "dm_DataDictionaryPublisher" failed to execute successfully. The message was:  "[ERROR] [LAUNCHER 6372] Detected while completing processing for job dm_DataDictionaryPublisher: Command Failed: save,s0,080f424680000234, status: 0, with error message [DM_SYSOBJECT_E_CANT_SAVE]error:   Cannot save 080f424680000234 sysobject. [DM_SYSOBJECT_E_VERSION_MISMATCH]error:   save of object failed because of version mismatch: old version was 554,024   ."

***********************************************

Job "dm_DataDictionaryPublisher" failed to execute successfully. The message was:  "[ERROR] [AGENTEXEC 4292] Detected while processing dead job dm_DataDictionaryPublisher: The job object indicated the job was in progress, but the job was not actually running.  It is likely that the dm_agent_exec utility was stopped while the job was in progress

Symptoms

Command Failed: save,s0,0800176f8000955a, status: 0, with error message [DM_SYSOBJECT_E_VERSION_MISMATCH]error:   save of object failed because of version mismatch: old version was 16460   ."  Job will not run

 Cause
Basically, the save operation of the object is failing because the version stamp in the object is inconsistent with the version stamp that is  stored in the database.

 Resolution

Execute the following API statements from DA:
API>fetch,c,0800176f8000955a
...
API>save,c,0800176f8000955a

 That was preventing the job from completing successfully. Once we issue these two API statements we will  be able to update the version for object 0800176f8000955a
 After having executed these commands wait for the next job execution and monitor it to see if the job will complete correctly.
