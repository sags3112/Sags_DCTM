What could cause all the jobs to fail with DM_SESSION_E_START_FAIL and DM_SESSION_E_AUTH_FAIL in the docbase log  with missing job reports ?


Check the environment settings the account in question. 


Notice if the account is using the environment variable $DOCUMENTUM. If the user does not have the correct environment variables the jobs will not run correctly. 


RESOLUTION: 


1) Create the environment by reviewing the eContent Server Installation Guide and Release Notes. 

2) Stop and Restart the docbase. 

3) Start a job. 


The errors should not exist.
