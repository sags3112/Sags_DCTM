Activating or Inactivating a Job

When you set a job to inactive, the agent exec process ignores the job when it polls the
repository and the job is never started by agent exec. When you set a job to active, the
agent exec examines the job when it polls the repository and executes the job on the
schedule defined in the job.

for particular job:

update dm_job objects set is_inactive=1 where object_name='Name of the job'.



A job’s activation status is recorded in its is_inactive attribute. To change the status,
use Documentum Administrator.

A job can be set to inactive automatically if you have set a maximum number of executions for the job. In such cases, the job is inactivated after the specified number of executions are completed. Similarly, if you specify an expiration date for a job, it is
inactivated on that date.

Disabling All Jobs


To disable all job executions, set the agent_launcher attribute in the server config object
to an empty string ("") and stop and restart the server. Stopping the server stops the
current running agent exec process. When you restart the server, the agent_exec process
is not launched.
