
How can you tell what jobs are to be launched by agentexec on the next cycle?


By default the agent_exec process runs every 5 minutes. When jobs are started, Documentum Adminstrator (DA) will update the dm_job_request. 


Here is a query to see what is listed to be run. 

select * from dm_job_request
