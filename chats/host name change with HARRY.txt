sag3112: Issue: 

Currently, our Documentum Content Server and Oracle database are each on SUN Solaris 10 servers. We are being required to change the names on both of  these servers. What are the concerns and impact on Documentum regarding a server name change? How imbedded are the server names throughout Documentum? What  must be done to have Documentum work with the name changes??

 

sag3112: I jst replied ct 
sag3112: Hi Mark, 

If you want to change the name of Content Server box, there is no known issues in version 5.3 SPx. But Oracle database in general will have issues if you change host name after installation. Please get in touch with your DBA in changing the Database machine name.

Let me know if you need any thing more. 

 

sag3112: now ct have changed the both server names ie CS and DB
sag3112: he says that documentum is not wrking
sag3112: mail from ct

Sagar,

 

We have completed testing of the server name change in our lab environment. The necessary modifications to effect the server name change were made to the operating system and Oracle. All looked good at this point. It was not until I attempted to bring the Documentum Content Server online that problems occurred. After starting the Docbroker and repositories, I attempted to log into Documentum. At this point, the login failed with errors related to the Docbroker not seeing the repositories. Looking further into the problem revealed that the content server was looking for the old server name.

 


sag3112: Apparently the server name is embedded in files on the content server. A search for files containing the old server name was done on the content server. The search revealed that files such as dmcl.ini, dm_launch_Docbroker, dm_stop_Docbroker, uninstall.ini, webcache.ini, server.ini, etc. contain the old server name. Does Documentum have any documentation covering this issue? Is there a document that lists the files where the server name is embedded? Can you provide some help in this matter?
hdedrickson: werent you working with Hitoshi on this ?
sag3112: yaa
hdedrickson: please continue with that
hdedrickson: i have already discussed that with him
sag3112: jst asking you on that
sag3112: ok
hdedrickson: It not helpful if 3 people ask me the same question
sag3112: ok
hdedrickson: i dont mean to be abrupt
hdedrickson: but we have a process here
sag3112: np sir
sag3112: got it
hdedrickson: if you need help go to your buddy
hdedrickson: if you buddy needs help he comes to me
sag3112: i thought u will give me still clear pict
sag3112: k
hdedrickson: yes but I have already explained this to hitoshi
sag3112: ok
sag3112: i will ask him now
hdedrickson: now there should be a sn on this
hdedrickson: trust me if he needs help he will contact me again
hdedrickson: i will be glad to help
hdedrickson: it may result in all three of us get on the phone and discuss this
hdedrickson: ok ?
sag3112: yaaaaaaaaa
sag3112: very clear
sag3112: sorry if i have done mistake
hdedrickson: no your find
hdedrickson: fine
hdedrickson: I want to follow the proces more
hdedrickson: anyway this kind of change makes one think about the server
hdedrickson: hostname change
hdedrickson: solving it requires one to really get to know the server better
hdedrickson: What OS is the ct on
sag3112: need to ask him
sag3112: not sure
hdedrickson: ok thats important
sag3112: k
hdedrickson: why ?
hdedrickson: cause one uses a registry
hdedrickson: one does not
sag3112: SUN Solaris 10 
hdedrickson: ok this change is easier
sag3112: k
hdedrickson: ok lets just do this
hdedrickson: what files can you think record hostname identification
hdedrickson: for dctm and the OS
hdedrickson: forget aboutt he docbase for now
hdedrickson: this if for the content server.
sag3112: k
hdedrickson: server.ini
hdedrickson: dmc.ini
hdedrickson: webcache.ini .. maybe
hdedrickson: /etc/hosts
hdedrickson: hostname output ?
hdedrickson: is dns updated.. ?
hdedrickson: are they using NIS ?
hdedrickson: are you with me /
sag3112: yaa
hdedrickson: ok
hdedrickson: so then the server config needs to be examined
sag3112: k
hdedrickson: r_host_name
hdedrickson: then the target_server attributes for all the jobs needs to be examined
sag3112: k
hdedrickson: when one update ther server.ini file and dmcl.ini file from $DOCUMENTUM
hdedrickson: and then restarts the docbase
hdedrickson: they need to see if the docbase is binding to its new hostname
hdedrickson: this means looking at docbase log
sag3112: k
sag3112: yaa
hdedrickson: once the docbase is up and running the metadata needs to be examined
hdedrickson: now you have FAST
hdedrickson: is FAST installed ?
sag3112: no
hdedrickson: thats better
sag3112: he didn't telll any thing reg that
hdedrickson: ok you need to ask just to make sure
sag3112: k
hdedrickson: The OS and network needs to be validated that it has completley been migrated over to the hostname...
hdedrickson: ie nslookup myshostname
sag3112: ok
hdedrickson: that another computer can reach this new system
hdedrickson: telnet newhostname
sag3112: k
hdedrickson: nslookup on this client can resolve the new hostname
hdedrickson: start from there.. 
sag3112: k
hdedrickson: then get back to me
sag3112: will try it out
sag3112: k
hdedrickson: sounds good
sag3112: yaaaaaaaaaaaa
