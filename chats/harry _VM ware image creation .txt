hdedrickson: well icant conduct a training session here in IM chat
sag3112: if u have any screen shots it will be grt
sag3112: k
hdedrickson: so what you need to do is start from  scratch and learn how to install a OS from an ISO image
hdedrickson: do you have msoft license keys?
hdedrickson: this way you can customized the disk image size
hdedrickson: and allocate it
sag3112: no
sag3112: no licence key
hdedrickson: where do you get the OS for your LABS ?
sag3112: IT people have installed this
hdedrickson: i see
hdedrickson: this will have to change i think
hdedrickson: I 'll talk to bob and folks about this..
hdedrickson: you need to free and unfettered access to various flavors of operating systems....
sag3112: ok
sag3112: jst pls give him an idea that let team know the process when he is herr
hdedrickson: how they are installed what versions are used impact our server
hdedrickson: anyway when you create a new machine
hdedrickson: you use custom
sag3112: ok
hdedrickson: then you click next
hdedrickson: then allow workstation 6.0
hdedrickson: then next
hdedrickson: then select Msoft windows then pick the drop down box and pick a specific version
hdedrickson: you need to know what this image is .,..
hdedrickson: click next
hdedrickson: then you type a name for machine , here you should have a descriptive name
hdedrickson: and then pick the path where the vmmachine will live
sag3112: k
hdedrickson: then you pick # of cpus's click next
hdedrickson: then select memory allocation
hdedrickson: then select networking.... bridge is the default
hdedrickson: however Oracle will not run without a fixed IP
sag3112: what abt teh option access rights
hdedrickson: then pick default for LSI logic
sag3112: shall i use the chk mark
hdedrickson: for bus type
hdedrickson: then you select use an existing disk
hdedrickson: then you browse to vmdk file you downloaded...
hdedrickson: then select open
hdedrickson: then select finish...
hdedrickson: then select Ok
sag3112: thnks man..
sag3112: got it..
hdedrickson: now the problem
sag3112: but small confuision here...
hdedrickson: you need to know the login password , for the OS
hdedrickson: since you are using a prebuilt OS
sag3112: u said select use an existing disk
hdedrickson: and your dependent on the image being clean and in functional order.
sag3112: wht i have to select 
hdedrickson: otherwise you are just using garbabe
hdedrickson: you pick an image from someone else vmware workstation someone who has gone thru the process of creating an OS from scratch
hdedrickson: all your doing is using someone else already created virtual machine
sag3112: ok
hdedrickson: the file is .vmdk
sag3112: i cant create new one
hdedrickson: you creating a new one
hdedrickson: are
hdedrickson: but using a preexisting image
hdedrickson: you cant create a new image without installing an OS or you can use one that already one
hdedrickson: those are your choices
sag3112: ok
hdedrickson: vmware doesnt install an OS
hdedrickson: you have to install it
sag3112: k
hdedrickson: once you install you can copy the images all over the place
hdedrickson: however the hostname, licenses, IP's are duplicated
sag3112: ok
sag3112: got it sir
hdedrickson: using other peoples images while fast make you dependent on others...and prone to thier problems
sag3112: yaaaaaaa
hdedrickson: you all need to be self sufficient
sag3112: right !!
hdedrickson: buts that our goal
hdedrickson: so it will take some time
hdedrickson: if you have a lack of resouces
hdedrickson: I will talk to your managers,
sag3112: ok
hdedrickson: bob will be good for that
sag3112: yaaaaa
sag3112: one more qstion
sag3112: jst guide us what to learn from bob when he is here..asome thing like what concepts if we cover it will be ok
sag3112: jst give us in nut shell
sag3112: what points if we know it will be good in the long run
hdedrickson: bob and I alreay have talked ..
sag3112: ohhhhhhhhh
hdedrickson: so he knows what to look for
sag3112: k
sag3112: thnks
sag3112: np then
hdedrickson: so you need to buddy up with folks you already have images built , send out a note what you are looking for 
hdedrickson: to server_support
hdedrickson: or TS_SERVER
hdedrickson: and ask for map locations for vmdk files
sag3112: k
hdedrickson: as to the vmware application isself 
hdedrickson: you may want to check how it was installed
hdedrickson: and you have full rights
sag3112: k
