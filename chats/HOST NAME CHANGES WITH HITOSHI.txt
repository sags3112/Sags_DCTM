hitoshi_ito2006: on webex now. I will let you know when i am free
sag3112: k
hitoshi_ito2006: or you can just type in your question and I will answer when i have time
sag3112: ok
sag3112: Issue: 

Currently, our Documentum Content Server and Oracle database are each on SUN Solaris 10 servers. We are being required to change the names on both of  these servers. What are the concerns and impact on Documentum regarding a server name change? How imbedded are the server names throughout Documentum? What  must be done to have Documentum work with the name changes??
sag3112: so i replied ct 
 

sag3112: Hi Mark, 

If you want to change the name of Content Server box, there is no known issues in version 5.3 SPx. But Oracle database in general will have issues if you change host name after installation. Please get in touch with your DBA in changing the Database machine name.

Let me know if you need any thing more. 

sag3112: now ct done the changes to CS box and oracle box
sag3112: Sagar,

 

We have completed testing of the server name change in our lab environment. The necessary modifications to effect the server name change were made to the operating system and Oracle. All looked good at this point. It was not until I attempted to bring the Documentum Content Server online that problems occurred. After starting the Docbroker and repositories, I attempted to log into Documentum. At this point, the login failed with errors related to the Docbroker not seeing the repositories. Looking further into the problem revealed that the content server was looking for the old server name.

 

Apparently the server name is embedded in files on the content server. A search for files containing the old server name was done on the content server.
sag3112: The search revealed that files such as dmcl.ini, dm_launch_Docbroker, dm_stop_Docbroker, uninstall.ini, webcache.ini, server.ini, etc. contain the old server name. Does Documentum have any documentation covering this issue? Is there a document that lists the files where the server name is embedded? Can you provide some help in this matter?
hitoshi_ito2006: looks like there are lots of things you have to take care.
hitoshi_ito2006: refer customer to the following forum threads
hitoshi_ito2006: forums.emc.com/forums/thread.jspa?tstart=0&threadID=66196

hitoshi_ito2006: what's the OS?
hitoshi_ito2006: ok so basically you can tell it's not a supported procedure
hitoshi_ito2006: too many things to consider
hitoshi_ito2006: but the forums I gave you have lots of good insight
hitoshi_ito2006: here are some chats I had with Harry:
hitoshi_ito2006: Harry Dedrickson: less a matter of supported
Harry Dedrickson: and more a matter of will it work
Harry Dedrickson: the customer needs to understand this can break many integrations....
Harry Dedrickson: FAST
Harry Dedrickson: CTS
hitoshi_ito2006: Harry Dedrickson: UNIX is easy
Harry Dedrickson: MSOFT more to consider
Harry Dedrickson: there should be sn's on this
hitoshi_ito2006: So basically, can I say (it would work, but) we don't support it
hitoshi_ito2006: ?
Harry Dedrickson: its more of best practices
Harry Dedrickson: we expect like any application vendor that the system will remain stable
Harry Dedrickson: what happens if you change the hostname for Oracle
Harry Dedrickson: it breaks the database listener
sag3112: hey..
sag3112: jst now came to seet
sag3112: after meeting with praveen
sag3112: u there
hitoshi_ito2006: yes
sag3112: u said its supported procedure
sag3112: right
sag3112: sorry its not supported procedure
hitoshi_ito2006: it will work, but not documented by us
sag3112: ok
hitoshi_ito2006: according to Harry (PSE), best practice is not to change system after installation
sag3112: but we said in the mail that

hitoshi_ito2006: Right, so there is no issue and docbase will work even after the change, but the step by step procedure is not available from us.
hitoshi_ito2006: there are so many things to consider.
hitoshi_ito2006: user authentication, docbroker (projection host), acs, replication, etc.
