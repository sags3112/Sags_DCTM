sag3112: “I am having problems setting up a set of users with the correct permissions for promoting documents to all of the lifecycle states.  At each state the document receives a new ACL as part of the promotion.  When I look at the Document information on a document in the expired state it shows that the user has Write, Run procedure, Change location, Change state, Change permission on the document but durring the promotion process the error [DM_SYSOBJECT_E_NO_VERSION_ACCESS]error. What is wrong and how can I tell?”

dmi_total_package: also get a dump of the docbaseconfig object
dmi_total_package: also, I don't think you can promote a document from the expired state

dmi_total_package: yes?
sag3112: jst let me know what to ask the ct
dmi_total_package: ask them for a dump of their docbaseconfig objet
dmi_total_package: ask them to tell you more about their workflow
dmi_total_package: lifecycle I mean
dmi_total_package: you'll need to get a screenshot of it or their docapp
dmi_total_package: also we need a dump of the acl on the document
dmi_total_package: who is the user doing the promote?
sag3112: k
dmi_total_package: but the most important thing is getting a dump of the docbaseconfig
dmi_total_package: when you get it, check out the value of the a_bpaction_run_as attribute
