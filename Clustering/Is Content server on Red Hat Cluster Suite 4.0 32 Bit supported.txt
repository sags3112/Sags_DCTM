UNIX clusters can work, but they're not supported (ie HP Service guard, Veritas clustering) due to virtual IPs that can mess things up pretty good.

Stephan,

I am pretty sure that Windows Clusters are the only supported clustering technique at the moment. I may be wrong though, someone else can confirm this?
UNIX Clusters are known to work though...
