Error installing docapps in Documentum 6.0 - DM_SYSOBJECT_E_CANT_FIND_CHRONICLE 


Symptoms

When installing a docapp in 6.0 SP1, you may receive an error as follows:

[DM_SYSOBJECT_E_CANT_FIND_CHRONICLE]error:  "Cannot get chronicle identifier for the sysobject name Rich_Media_Services."!] 

This can vary depending on the docapp being installed.

 

Cause

This issue occurs due to an incorrect chronicle id on the object

 

Resolution

In order to isolate this issue, a dfc trace will have to be performed on the server hosting the application installer. 

1. To enable the dfc trace, modify the dfc.properties file under the ..Documentum/config folder. Add the following entry:dfc.tracing.enabled=true

2. Once complete, try installing the docapp using Docapp Installer. 

3. Once the error occurs, turn off the tracing in the dfc.properties file by setting the trace value to false. 

4. Navigate to the trace file under Documentum\log. Examining this log will show the complete error as follows:

 

[main] com.documentum.fc.client.DfSysObject@4ca6b6.appendPart(DfId{0801834e80070e26},null,true,false,0) ==>  [!com.documentum.fc.common.DfException: [DM_SYSOBJECT_E_CANT_FIND_CHRONICLE]error:  "Cannot get chronicle identifier for the sysobject name Rich_Media_Services."!] 

 

The r_object_id of the problem object is listed as 0801834e80070e26

5. Obtain an API dump of this object:

API>dump,c,0801834e80070e26

6. Note the i_chronicle_id. It should show all zeros

7. Update the i_chronicle_id to be equal to the r_object_id:

API>set,c,0801834e80070e26,i_chronicle_id

SET>0801834e80070e26

API>save,c,l

8. Rerun the docapp installation and the error should no longer appear.
