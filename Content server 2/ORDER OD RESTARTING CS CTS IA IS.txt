Thanks. I need bit more info regarding the restart order. Our current
setup is

Content server (Docbroker,docbase,Java method server)

Index server on a separate windows server

Content transformation services on a separate windows server.

So please let me know restart order for our complete setup


Soluton:

Stopping order would be:

1. CTS services
2. Index Server services
3. Content Server services

OR

1. Index Server services
2. CTS services
3. Content Server services

Stopping services within Index Server and the order would be:
1. Index Agents
2. Index Server

Starting order:

1. Content Server services
2. Index Server services
3. CTS services
Or 2 and 3 can be the other way around.
