On UNIX and Linux, ensure that these environment variables are set in the
installation owner’s environment:
— ORACLE_HOME
— TNS_ADMIN
This environment variable points to the location of the tnsnames.ora file. The Content
Server installation program looks first for TNS_ADMIN, then for ORACLE_HOME,
in order to locate the tnsnames.ora file.
