trying to install Documentum 6.0 in a test environment, and keep receiving an error when I attempt to create the first repository.  

The error message is:  DiUtil: Unable to set permission of file: O:\data

Unable to get DACL - Access is denied.

********

The Content Server is installed to a local directory, and I am attempting to allocate a repository to a directory on a separate file server(ie docbase data on remote server).  I have allocated space on that file server and given my installation owner domain account Full permissions on that directory ..


Finally allocating a repository to a directory on a separate file serverie remote server is not recomonded and its bug in 5.3 and D6

Its problem with NTFS file system not with FAT 32.If you try doing the same in FAT32 its works.
