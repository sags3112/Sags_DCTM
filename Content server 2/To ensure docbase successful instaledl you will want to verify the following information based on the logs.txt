Verifying your install
To ensure a successful install you will want to verify the following information based on the logs.

 

Docbase log. Review the docbase log to ensure that it started up appropriately.

PATH-C:\Documentum\dba\logs\<docbasename>.log

JMS log. This log will ensure that your Java Method Server is running.

MEthod Server Wrapper log

C:\Documentum\bea9.2\domains\DctmDomain\serviceConfig\MethodServer

Method Server Log

 

*Note that if this folder has not been created, that means that the Weblogic server is still starting up, This could take 5-10 minutes depending on machine resources.

 

C:/Documentum/bea9.2/domains/DctmDomain/servers/DctmServer_MethodServer_<host>/data/MethodServer/logs

 

To verify that all the Method Server is starting up all of the necessary servlets you will need to access the Weblogic Managed Server Console.

 

http://localhost:7001/console

 

You will need to use the same login that you set during the content server installation

user: weblogic, password: weblogic

 

 

 

Modify the Method server to reduce its memory requirement.

C:\Documentum\bea9.2\domains\DctmDomain\startMethodServer.cmd
