"NO JMS Available error" in CS HA mode where *MULTILE* DOCUMENTUM PROCESS running on one CS host

Symptoms

When we install 6.6 in HA environment,
One CS host having Multiple Documentum Processes -> where jobs and methods run on once process on another process JMS throws error message. "NO JMS Available"
Multiple CS Host with one Documentum Process per host
and all jobs and methods can only run on primary content server successfully, and it always fails on the secondary server.
 
Docbase log throws the following error message when jobs and method is posted to run on the secondary server.
 
Sat Mar 26 08:14:30 2011 064531: 8663[8663] JMS DEBUG: NO JMS available, method_id=1001551f8011cd07,method_name=MoveToRecycleBin, trace_launch=1, is_restartable=0, appServerName=do_method, is_workflow=0, jms_location=ANY
 
Cause

In 6.6, the JMS failover was introduced, therefore a new object type - dm_jms_config can be found in 6.6.
Each CS has one JMS which will have one dm_jms_config object associated.
If there are
One content server and one JMS, but having multiple documentum process configured or
Two content servers and two JMS servers, it has to have two dm_jms_config objects.
Bby default Documentum will associate one dm_jms_config with once Documentum process to dm_server_config object. Hence the other documentum process can not use the JMS. 
 
Having 1 Jboss instance serving 2 Documentum instances but the dm_jms_config only references one of the Documentum Instance.
NOTE:  This was working fine prior to 6.5, but due to the introduction of dm_jms_config which supports the JMS failover you have to update the dm_server_config with the another documentum process.
You are hitting a bug (CS-31755)
 
Resolution

Run the dm_jms_admin.sh script to assigned an additional server_config_id for the missing documentum instance.
Run the following script on CS host which has multiple documentum process.
$DOCUMENTUM_SHARED/jmsTools/bin/dm_jms_admin.sh  by passing values
E.g:
$DOCUMENTUM_SHARED/jmsTools/bin/dm_jms_admin.sh  -docbase <docbase_documentum instnace name> -username dmadmin -action add,enableDFC,testDFC,migrate,dumpServerCache,listAll  -jms_host_name <hostname as per server config> -jms_port <JMS port no> -jms_proximity 1 -webapps ServerApps  -server_config_id <server config id>
which is something like below:
$DOCUMENTUM_SHARED/jmsTools/bin/dm_jms_admin.sh  -docbase KP66REPO.KP66REPO_service2 -username dmadmin -action add,enableDFC,testDFC,migrate,dumpServerCache,listAll  -jms_host_name kpcs006.awdocumentum.com -jms_port 9080 -jms_proximity 1 -webapps ServerApps  -server_config_id 3d00638880373901
