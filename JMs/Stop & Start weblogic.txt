To stop an admin server:

1. On Windows:

a. Navigate to DctmUserDir\bea9.2\domains\DctmDomain\bin.
b. Execute stopWeblogic.cmd

2. On UNIX:
a. Navigate to DctmUserDir/bea9.2/domains/DctmDomain/bin.
b. Execute stopWeblogic.sh
Use the following procedure to start an admin server.

Starting and stopping the instance servers

An instance server hosts one or more Java applications or processes. In a Content Server
installation, the method server instance server hosts the Java Method Server, ACS server,
and the DmMail application, for example.
Before you start an instance server using the script, be sure that the Weblogic admin
server is running. Starting an instance server using the Windows service also starts
the admin server if it is stopped.

Note: Do not use the BEA Admin Console to stop or start an instance server or the
applications they host. Use the procedures in this section.

To start an instance server:

1. On Windows:

b. Execute startapplicationGroupName.cmd

The applicationGroupName for the instance server installed with a Content Server
installation is ’MethodServer’. Consequently, to start that instance, you execute
startMethodServer.cmd.

c. Alternatively, start the Windows service for the server instance.
For the Java method server, and the server instance hosting the Java method
server, the service name is Documentum Java Method Server. Starting that
service is equivalent to executing startMethodServer.cmd.

2. On UNIX:
a. Navigate to DctmUserDir/bea9.2/domains/DctmDomain.
b. Execute startapplicationGroupName.sh.
The applicationGroupName for the instance server installed with a Content Server
installation is ’MethodServer’. Consequently, to start that instance, you execute
startMethodServer.sh.
Use the following procedure to stop an instance server. Stopping an instance server stops
all applications running within the instance.

b. Execute stopapplicationGroupName.cmd
The applicationGroupName for the instance server installed with a Content Server
installation is ’MethodServer’. Consequently, to start that instance, you execute
stopMethodServer.cmd.
c. Alternatively, stop the Windows service for the server instance.
For the Java method server, and the server instance hosting the Java method
server, the service name is Documentum Java Method Server. Stopping that
service is equivalent to executing stopMethodServer.cmd.
