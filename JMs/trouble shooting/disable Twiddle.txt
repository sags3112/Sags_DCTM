
Here is steps to disable Twiddle, I create  esg128610  for this

Symptoms
 
1) JBOSS java method server terminates unexpectedly  without any error message
2) JBOSS throw following error message
   2012-04-11 09:48:05,050 WARN  [org.jboss.system.ServiceController] Problem starting service jboss:service=invoker,type=jrmp
java.rmi.server.ExportException: Port already in use: 8066; nested exception is: 
 java.net.BindException: Address already in use: JVM_Bind
 
Cause
 
This issue  maybe is  caused by Twiddle  status check of JBOSS application, we see this issue occurs many time with JBOSS JMS Server.
Twiddle will monitor JBOSS application, if JBOSS is busy or is down, twiddle will shutdown JBOSS and restart it again.
The issue is that, sometime, JBOSS is running and all port is listening, however, JBOSS is busy to response to twiddle monitor script.
The Twiddle will treat JBOSS is down, then Twiddle to try to restart it. However, as you can see JBOSS is still running, that is reason , new JBOSS start will fail due to port is occupied by running JBOSS application
then JBOSS application will go down within 20 minutes
 
Resolution
 
1)  Make a copy of file $Documentum\jboss4.2.0\bin\<hostname>_status_output.txt file that contains "true",  and named it "override_status_output.txt" in the bin directory.
2)  Backup dctmServerStatus.bat to dctmServerStatus.bat.backup, open dctmServerStatus.bat
    edited the line: 
   REM clean up temp file from previous run if it exists
    IF EXIST %CHECK_FILE% DEL /F %CHECK_FILE%
    REM run twiddle to get server status
    call twiddle.bat --server=%HOST%:%PORT% %CREDENTIALS% get --noprefix "jboss.system:type=Server" Started > %CHECK_FILE%
  TO: 
 REM clean up temp file from previous run if it exists
 REM IF EXIST %CHECK_FILE% DEL /F %CHECK_FILE%
 REM run twiddle to get server status
 call twiddle.bat --server=%HOST%:%PORT% %CREDENTIALS% get --noprefix "jboss.system:type=Server" Started > override_status_output.txt 
 
3)    Restart JMS and keep monitor JMS, and issue should be resolved
