Symptoms

When working in a clustered Content Server environment, the following error may be seen in the Java Method Server logs when launching java methods:

javax.servlet.ServletException: Request originated from illegal IP Address:192.168.1.1



Cause

In the above message, the referenced IP is the virtual IP which is referenced in the Do_Method value for the app_server_uri listed in the dm_server_config object. In addition to adding it to the server config object, it may also be required to add it to the web.xml for the Java Method Server.



Resolution

1. Navigate to $DOCUMENTUM_SHARED/jboss4.2.0/server/DctmServer_MethodServer/deploy/ServerApps.ear/DmMethods.war/WEB-INF and open the web.xml with an editor.
2. Add the following parameter to the file
<init-param>
  <param-name>ip-</param-name>
  <param-value>192.168.1.1</param-value>
</init-param>

Replace the above IP with that of the Virtual host.

3. Restart Java Method Server
