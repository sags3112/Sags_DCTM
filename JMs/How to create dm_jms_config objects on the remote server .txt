How to create dm_jms_config objects on the remote server manually on remote server

Symptoms

When we install 6.6 HA environment, and all jobs and methods can only run on primary content server successfully, and it always fails on the secondary server.
 
Docbase log throws the following error message when jobs and method is posted to run on the secondary server.
Sat Nov 20 18:14:16 2010 756180: 9406[9406] JMS DEBUG: NO JMS available, method_id=1001cd77800dff4f, method_name=xxxxxxx
fo, trace_launch=1, is_restartable=0, appServerName=do_method, is_workflow=0, jms_location=ANY

Cause

In 6.6, the JMS failover was introduced, therefore a new object type - dm_jms_config can be found in 6.6. Each JMS server have one dm_jms_config object associated. If there are two content servers and two JMS servers, it has to have two dm_jms_config objects.
 
When CT runs CFS configuration program, it did not create a dm_jms_config object properly on the remote Content Server. Normally, you should see the error  dm_jms_config_setup.out as the following:
Wrong number of arguments (4) passed to entry point 'installForRCS'.
Fail to connect to second server

Resolution

Run the following script on Remote Server to create a second dm_jms_config object
./dmbasic  $DM_HOME\install\admin\dm_jms_config_setup.ebs -e installForRCS -- <docbase> <install_owner > <install_owner passwd>  <hostname> <Jms_port>
After the second dm_jms_config object is created, the issue should be resolved.
