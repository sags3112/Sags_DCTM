Symptoms:


You are getting OutOfMemoryError errors in the Java Method Server (on Windows).



Cause:


Java Method Server service is actually an Apache Tomcat which serves requests for method executions through the method exposed in it.



Apache Tomcat is a Java application, therefore it runs inside a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). An OutOfMemoryError is thrown by Java whenever it runs out of memory for new objects (this memory region is called 'heap').



Resolution:


The maximum heap size for a Java Virtual Machine is defined when starting it. It cannot be changed while the Java Virtual Machine is running.



The maximum heap size is usually set using Java command line parameters. However, since Java Method Server runs as a service, we need to configure how the service is launched, so it can start the JVM properly.



This can be achieved in two ways:



1) Using the Apache Service Configuration tool:

1.1) Navigate to the directory: C:\Program Files\Documentum\tomcat\5.0.28\bin (assuming you are using the default directories).

1.2) Run the tool: tomcat5w.exe

1.3) Click on the Java tab

1.4) Modify the 'Initial Memory Pool' and 'Maximum Memory Pool' values (i.e. from 256 to 512 MB).

1.5) Click Apply

1.6) Restart the Java Method Server

If the tomcat5w.exe tool is not available, here is another way of altering this values:



2) Using the registry editor:

2.1) Open the registry editor (Start > Run > "regedit")

2.2) Navigate to the registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Apache Software Foundation\Procrun 2.0\DmJavaMethodServer\Parameters\Java

2.3) Modify the values for JvmMs and JvmMx

2.4) Restart the Java Method Server service

Other Tips:



1) If you need to increase the maximum memory size up to a high value, it might happen that the Java Method Server is suffering a memory leak. Therefore, increasing the maximum heap size will only delay the problem, but not solve it.



2) There is a command line tool (tomcat5.exe) to alter the JvmMs and JvmMx values. However, bugs have been reported on Tomcat version 5.0.28, so be aware it might not work.
