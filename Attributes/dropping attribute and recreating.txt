What are the SQL statements needed to delete and recreate a custom attribute on a custom type when using a MS SQL Server docbase?

Before doing this make sure you have a backup of your database! It is recommend that the SQL Server DBA perform these operations. 

PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS NOT SUPPORTED OR RECOMMENDED, SO YOU TAKE THESE STEPS AND THIS WORKAROUND AT YOUR OWN RISK. 

Here is what you need to do (Exact syntax cannot be given as it is not known exactly what your table looks like.): 

1) Make sure the attribute you removed has been deleted from the dm_type_r table using these queries: 

select r_object_id_i from dm_type_s where name='<type name>' 

select * from dm_type_r where attr_name='<attribute name the was removed>' and r_object_id_i= <id returned from previous query> 
(If this returns 0 rows then proceed to step 2) 

2) Run sp_help on your custom type tablename to get the table definition & save the output to a file for future use. 
sp_help <tablename> 

3) Create a table with a new name that is identical to the original table, (based the sp_help output from step ) but WITHOUT the column that needs to be removed. 

4) Insert the rows from the columns needed in the original table to the new table: 

insert into new_table (select <column> from <original_table>) 

5) Drop the original table 

6) Rename the new table to the same name as the original: 

sp_rename 'old name', 'new name' 

7) Create the same indexes on the new table per the sp_help output in step 2. 

8) At this point you should be able to add the attribute back to your custom type.
