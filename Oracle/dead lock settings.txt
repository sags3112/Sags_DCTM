
My customer (Morgan Stanley) experiences deadlocks with SQL server 2005. Engineering recommends enabling of READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT and ALLOW_SNAPSHOT_ISOLATION at the DB level. However their DBAs are reluctant to enable these settings due to tempDB growth. 

They want to talk to few customers who have these settings enabled in production. I was wondering if have a customer with these settings enabled and are willing to talk to Morgan Stanley for few minutes, then please let me know the contact details.


****************


These settings will keep from the deadlocks and I have recommended to many customers these settings when they experience deadlocks.  I have not heard anything back negative.
