
To remove the certificate, you should be able to go to the dba\secure\ldapdb folder and remove the certificate. Then you need to restart JMS and the docbase.
However, I have seen it be cached as well. So if after doing the above, they try to install a new one and get an error that it already exists, have them search the appserver for files containing the name of the cert. This should bring back an XML file…if so, remove it. If not, maybe just regular appserver cache
