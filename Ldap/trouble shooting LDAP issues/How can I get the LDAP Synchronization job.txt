How can I get the LDAP Synchronization job to run a full refresh against a docbase where I have already deleted docbase  users from a previous  LDAP job 

The LDAP Sychronization job keeps a record of its last run. The time is recorded in the a_last_run attribute for the LDAP Config Object. If you modify the a_last_run attribute of your LDAP config object to "NULL" and clear the time stamp and rerun the job it will fully populate the docbase with all the users from LDAP. 

Note when you set the value to NULL you do not enter the word NULL simply do not enter any value. In addition when you use IAPI in Documentum Administrator a data field is presented. When you use IAPI in the command line there is no Date field , after you do a SET comand the next line becomes the data field 

See both examples below. 

To change the a_last_run to NULL/Blank. 

From API on command line: 
API>retrieve,c,dm_ldap_config 
API>set,c,l,a_last_run 
SET> *NOTE: leave this field blank 
SET>save,c,l 

Or 

From API on DA 
Command:retrieve,c,dm_ldap_config 
Select Execute 
Command: set,c,l,a_last_run 
Data: *NOTE: leave this field blank 
Select Execute 
Command:save,c,l 

Or 

Run the LDAPSync from command line on server system in the $DM_HOME/bin or %DM_HOME%\bin 
Fill in your own values for the options and ensure your paths are correct. 

CS 5.1 and lower: 
java -classpath 
"../classes:../classes/com/documentum/ldap/ldapfilt.jar:../classes/com/documentum/ldap/ldapjdk.jar:$DOCUMENTUM_SHARED/dctm.jar" com.documentum.ldap.LDAPSync -bDocbaseName -uDocbaseAdminUser -pPassword -t10 -ntrue 

CS 5.2 and higher: 
java com.documentum.ldap.LDAPSync -bDocbaseName -uDocbaseAdminUser -pPassword -t10 -ntrue 

The last entry -ntrue will disregard the the a_last_runr
