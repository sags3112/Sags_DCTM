Symptoms

When running the dm_LDAPSynchronization job, the following error may be encountered:

[DM_LDAP_SYNC_E_EXCEPTION_ERROR]error:  "Operational User Properties not allowed in Attribute Mapping"

Cause

This error indicates that there is a problem with the mappings listed on the LDAP Config Object. 

Any required attribute listed in the mappings cannot have a constant value specified in the mapping. 

This applies to the following attributes:

user_name
user_login_name
user_address
group_name
user_login_domain
Resolution

To resolve this issue, make sure that the attributes listed above are not mapped to a constant value. For example, user_login_domain cannot be mapped to a hard coded value such as "TESTLDAP". For this particular attribute, there should be no mapping as this attribute is automatically populated by the dm_LDAPSynchronization run.
