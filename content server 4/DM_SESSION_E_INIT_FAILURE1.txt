Does anybody knows what Content Server checks during the following steps, that could lead to this DM_SESSION_E_INIT_FAILURE1?

The SQL trace is not helpful since it finishes the queries, and the error comes after that. I would rather like to know what kind of error could lead to a DM_SESSION_E_INIT_FAILURE1. What does the Content Server check or try to do?

Here’s a potential 5.3 to 6.x upgrade issue you might be seeing as more customers upgrade.

Esg96192:

Symptoms

After doing an upgrade from 5.3 to 6.0, you may see the following error in the docbase log on docbase startup:

Why am I seeing an error like "[DM_SESSION_E_INIT_FAILURE1]error:  "Failure to complete Distributed Content Digital Signatures initialization."" when starting the docbase after an upgrade from 5.3 to 6.0"

Note that even if you've already performed the steps from esg74708, you may have to perform the steps below for 6.0 now as well.

Cause

This is likely seen in an environment that has been cloned or copied from another environment.  The ACS crypto key is referencing the cloned system.

Resolution

The following in SQLPlus will remove the public/private ACS keys.  Please ensure you have a backup before you make any directly modifications against the database in SQLPlus.

Stop your repository.

1)delete dm_sysobject_s where r_object_id = 
(select r_object_id from dm_public_key_certificate_s where key_type = 1);

2) delete dm_sysobject_r where r_object_id = 
(select r_object_id from dm_public_key_certificate_s where key_type = 1);
 

3) delete dm_public_key_certificate_s where key_type = 1;

4) delete dm_sysobject_s where r_object_id = 
(select r_object_id from dm_cryptographic_key_s where key_type = 1);

5) delete dm_sysobject_r where r_object_id = 
(select r_object_id from dm_cryptographic_key_s where key_type = 1); 

6) delete dm_cryptographic_key_s where key_type = 1;


Restart your repository.  The error should no longer appear in the docbase log and the docbase should start up normally now
