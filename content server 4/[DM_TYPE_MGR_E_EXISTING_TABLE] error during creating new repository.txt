Symptoms

Failed to configure Docbase and found the following error message in the docbase logfile:



Mon Nov 05 16:06:13 2007 926000 [DM_TYPE_MGR_E_EXISTING_TABLE]error:  "Cannot create type dm_mount_point because the table dm_mount_point_s unexpectedly already exists in the database and the server 'preserve_existing_types' flag is enabled.  To complete this operation the table must first be manually dropped or the server flag disabled."
Mon Nov 05 16:06:13 2007 946000 [DM_MTPT_F_INIT3]fatal:  "The dm_mount_point object subsystem could not be initialized.  A failure was detected attempting to store the dm_mount_point type."
Mon Nov 05 16:06:13 2007 946000 [DM_SESSION_E_INIT_FAILURE1]error:  "Failure to complete dmMountPoint initialization."
Mon Nov 05 16:06:13 2007 946000 [DM_SERVER_I_START_ID]info:  "Docbase dev_doc16 was not successfully opened. Docbase id: (105216)"




Cause

In this case, table dm_mount_point_s exists (it could be different a table name, but you can use the same steps by just changing the table name).



Resolution

Remove the 'preserve_existing_types' flag from the server startup options or set it to false in server.ini and restart the server. 

 

If the above suggestion is not helpful, you may need to drop the table manually in SQL Server since Docbase can start when the tables are dropped.  You can make a backup before by creating table dm_mount_point _s2 as select * from dm_mount_point _s.  Follow the steps detailed below:

- Stop the docbase in Server Manager.
- Back up the view:
   SQL> create view dm_mount_point_sv2 as select * from dm_mount_point_sv;
   SQL> create view dm_mount_point_rp2 as select * from dm_mount_point_rp;
   SQL> create view dm_mount_point_sp2 as select * from dm_mount_point_sp;
- Drop the view:
   SQL> drop view dm_mount_point_sv;
   SQL> drop view dm_mount_point_rp;
   SQL> drop view dm_mount_point_sp;
- Back up the table:  SQL> create table dm_mount_point_s2 as select * from dm_mount_point_s;
- Drop the table:  SQL> drop table dm_mount_point_s;
- Start the Docbase in Server Manager.
