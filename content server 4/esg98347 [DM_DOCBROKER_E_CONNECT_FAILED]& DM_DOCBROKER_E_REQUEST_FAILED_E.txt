 esg98347  How to troubleshoot docbroker request failure?






Cause


Possibly a third party application, such as ProActiveNet agent, generated 20 connections to docbroker that never release and blocks all docbroker connection ports.



Resolution

1) Run netstat -b | grep 1489 to find out if a third party application generated 20 connections to the docbroker that did not release. 

- run netstat -an | grep 1489

- calculate how many docbroker connections .

- if there are 20 established docbroker connections, this indicates that there are no more available docbroker connections and no new connections will be accepted by docbroker. 



2) Locating the application that is creating the 20 docbroker connections that aren't released. 

- run the following command: 

      unix command :   netstat -p | grep 1489

      window command : netstat -b | grep 1489

The return results will identify which  process creates a docbroker connection, and Identify why the process did not close the connection to the docbroker.

  

3) Once the application is identified, you can shutdown the problematical application, and  then you will see the docbroker connections will go back to normal stage. 



4) meanwhile, you need to do other research and  find out why that application did not release docbroker connections.
