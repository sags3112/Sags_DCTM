While upgrading 65 to 6.7:

[DM_SESSION_E_AUTH_PLUGIN_LOAD_ERROR]error:  "Failed to load Authentication Plugin /opt/app/documentum/dba/auth/dm_netegrity_auth.so. Reason: Generic Status: Library Open failed, Library Name: /opt/app/documentum/dba/auth/dm_netegrity_auth.so, Platform Status: ld.so.1: documentum: fatal: libsmagentapi.so: open failed: No such file or directory."




Symptoms

The following issue happens after setting up Documentum Netegrity Authentication Plugin ('dm_netegrity').

You may see the below error in the docbase logfile when docbase is starting:



Thu Oct 01 16:29:19 2009 027000 [DM_SESSION_E_AUTH_PLUGIN_LOAD_ERROR]error:  "Failed to load Authentication Plugin D:\Documentum\dba\auth\gTestISU001\dm_netegrity_auth.dll. Reason: Generic Status: Library Open failed, Library Name: D:\Documentum\dba\auth\gTestISU001\dm_netegrity_auth.dll, Platform Status: System was out of memory, executable file was corrupt, or relocations were invalid." 



Cause

In 6.5 the steps to setup Netegrity changed slightly.



Resolution

Compared to 5.3, in 6.5 you will need to copy also smerrlog.dll from C:\Documentum\product\6.5\install\external_apps\authplugins\netegrity into %DM_HOME%\bin apart from SMAgentAPI.dll, as described in the README.txt. 

In 5.3 you don't need smerrlog.dll.



Steps in 6.5 SP2 from the Netegrity README.txt file:



1. Copy the file 
     dm_netegrity_auth.dll (Windows) or 
     dm_netegrity_auth.so (Solaris / AIX / Linux) or
     dm_netegrity_auth.sl (HPUX) 
   to the authentication plugin location (usually $DOCUMENTUM/dba/auth).

2. Copy the file dm_netegrity_auth.ini to the same location. 
   Edit this file and set all mandatory parameters.

3. Copy the supporting shared libraries:
     Windows: copy the files smagentapi.dll & smerrlog.dll to %DM_HOME%\bin
     Solaris/AIX: copy the files libsmagentapi.so & libsmerrlog.so to $DM_HOME/bin
     Linux: copy the files libsmagentapi.so, libsmcommonutil.so & libsmerrlog.so to $DM_HOME/bin
     HPUX: copy the files libsmagentapi.sl & libsmerrlog.sl to $DM_HOME/bin

4. Restart the docbase. You can verify that the plugin has been loaded by looking in the main server log file ($DOCUMENTUM/dba/log/<docbase>.log) for an entry starting with "[DM_SESSION_I_AUTH_PLUGIN_LOADED]info".

This completes the server-side installation. Refer to the WDK documentation to setup the application server side.

Why might I see DM_SESSION_E_AUTH_PLUGIN_AUTH_FAIL errors in the repository log when the Netegrity plugin loads and can valid users? 


This particular error can be seen sometimes in a repository log file as illustrated below: 


Mon Mar 13 17:46:17 2006 222075 [DM_SESSION_I_INIT_BEGIN]info: "Initialize Authentication Plugins." 

Mon Mar 13 17:46:17 2006 253783 [DM_SESSION_I_AUTH_PLUGIN_LOADED]info: "Loaded Authentication Plugin with code 'dm_netegrity' (/opt/local/dmadmin/v5.3/dba/auth/dm_netegrity_auth.so)." 

Mon Mar 13 17:46:17 2006 261173 [DM_SESSION_E_AUTH_PLUGIN_LOAD_ERROR]error: "Failed to load Authentication Plugin /opt/local/dmadmin/v5.3/dba/auth/libsmagentapi.so. Reason: Plugin verification failed. Could not find dm_plugin_version API in the plugin." 

Mon Mar 13 17:46:17 2006 281656 [DM_SERVER_I_START_SERVER]info: "Docbase test_docbase opened" 





This happens when the libsmagentapi.so library is incorrectly installed. This library should be installed under $DM_HOME/bin. If encountering this problem then the library has also been installed under $DOCUMENTUM/dba/auth. 



To resolve this delete the copy under $DOCUMENTUM/dba/auth and ensure that it is properly installed under $DM_HOME/bin.
