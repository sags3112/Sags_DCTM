Symptoms

Application Server with Document Administrator (DA) is deployed on a separate machine from Content Server.

On the AppServer machine, all the steps indicated in DA 6 SP1 Deployment Guide were followed:
- Disable tag reuse in Apache Tomcat in the web.xml file of the Tomcat /conf directory (page 23)
- Enabling DFC connections to repositories (page 40)

We checked that the port (1489) indicated in dfc.properties is open in firewall.

However,after deploying the .WAR file on Apache Tomcat 5.5.25 we receive the following message in the log file:  

2:51:31,379 ERROR Trace
 Preference repository is not available, reason: repository credentials are not valid
com.documentum.web.env.PreferenceRepository$DisabledException: repository credentials are not valid
at com.documentum.web.env.PreferenceRepository.initialize(PreferenceRepository.java:248)
...
Caused by: DfServiceException:: THREAD: Thread-1; MSG: [DFC_SESSION_DOCBASE_UNREACHABLE] Docbase "testdocbase" is unreachable; ERRORCODE: ff; NEXT: null
at com.documentum.fc.client.impl.connection.docbase.DocbaseConnection.establishNewRpcClient(DocbaseConnection.java:228)




Cause

Port defined in \Winnt\System32\drivers\etc\services file must also be open in firewall.



Resolution

Open the ports on the firewall for Content Server defined in: 
Windows: \Winnt\System32\drivers\etc\services.ini 
Unix: /etc/services
 
For example, if these entries exist for the primary Content Server:
 testdocbase 10000/tcp # repository service caruso
 testdocbase_s 10001/tcp # repository secure service

Then open ports 10000 and 10001.

Restart the docbase.
