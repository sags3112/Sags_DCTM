Symptoms

During an upgrade in CS 5.3.x dmdbtest may hang



Cause

$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/sqlnet.ora NAMES.NO_PERSISTENT_RESOURCES  parameter is incorrectly set.



Resolution

dmdbtest hanging during upgrade

During an upgrade in CS 5.3.x dmdbtest may hang. In case that happens you should start troubleshooting the issue by looking at the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/sqlnet.ora file.

More than likely the parameter NAMES.NO_PERSISTENT_RESOURCES is set to TRUE. So, make sure that the parameter NAMES.NO_PERSISTENT_RESOURCES is set to FALSE. Subsequent run of the of dmdbtest, after this setting has been changed, will be successful.
