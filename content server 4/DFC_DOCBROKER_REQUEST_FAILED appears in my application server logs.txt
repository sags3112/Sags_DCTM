Symptoms

Seeing DFC_DOCBROKER_REQUEST_FAILED in your application server logs and the WDK application does not start correctly.



Cause

You have failed to add the connection broker (formerly docbroker) to the dfc.properties file.



Resolution

To configure connections in dfc.properties before deployment:
1. Unpack the application WAR file.
2. Open the file dfc.properties in WEB-INF/classes.
3. Add the fully qualified host name or IP address for the docbroker to the following key. You can add backup hosts by incrementing the index number within brackets: dfc.docbroker.host[0]=host_name
4. If you wish to use a port for the docbroker other than the default of 1489, add a port key to dfc.properties: dfc.docbroker.port=port_number
