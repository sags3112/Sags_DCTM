Though all the configurations are fine and cleints are able to access it: still you may see the warnings in the logs


Resolution:


This is just an info message and will not impact any services. IPv6 is next generation internet protocol and is successor to IPv4. IPv6 is for larger address space (128 bit) as against 32 bit of IPv4. Customer should check with system admin to configure IPv6 for host machine OS if supported. IPV6 provides flexibility in allocation addresses and routing traffic and eliminates the primary need for network address translation 

 If ct do want to see IPV6 warning message, you can disable it , add following entry to server.ini
    ip_mode=V4ONLY


or


Try it in all upper case.
IP_MODE=V4ONLY
