Hi Everyone
 
Does anyone know how to stop AS4SAP SP1 cache files at c:\winnt\sytem32\dmcl\, Due to this customer is running out of disc space in C drive and eventually causing the performance problems. Is this the expected behavior? I raised this query to SAP engineering, they conformed that this is server side problem. I am not really sure why application server is caching files and not deleting them when the work is completed.
 
Is there any way or work around to permanently stop AS4SAP cache any files at c:\winnt\sytem32\dmcl\ location or can I set client_cache_size=0 so that none of the objects gets cached. Does CS have any performance problem if we change that attribute to zero. 


Solution:

Sumanth,
you may change that location by adding the following parameter in the dmcl.ini file.
 
local_path=<your desire path>
