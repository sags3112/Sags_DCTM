How can I make sure that a fresh installation of Documentum products takes place?

If you have a situation where the Documentum installer complains that there are remnants of a newer Documentum version already installed on the system, re-name the vpd.properties file. This file is usually in C:\Winnt, but a quick search of the filesystem should be able to find it. 


Before re-naming the file, make sure that you have uninstalled the Documentum Products and removed the corresponding directories (usually C:\Documentum and C:\Program Files\Documentum).
