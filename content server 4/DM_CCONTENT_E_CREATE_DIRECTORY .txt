Make sure the ":dm_mount_point" object is set to the correct "file_system_path," and that the "dm_location" object is set to the correct "file_system_path." 


Perform a dql "select" statement, as enclosed below, to see what "mount_point_name" is set for the "object_name": 


select object_name, file_system_path, mount_point_name from dm_location 



Then perform another "select" statement to see if the "correct file_system_path" is set for the "dm_mount_point" object. This time the select statement should appear similar to the following: 


select object_name, file_system_path from dm_mount_point 



Finally, correct the path if necessary.
