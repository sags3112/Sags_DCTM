Need to change SMTP server after install.



Cause

Content Server Installation Guide 5.3 SP1 page 43 has the following details on SMTP Server setting:
-----------------------------------
SMTP server on Windows
 
On Windows hosts, Content Server must be able to connect to an SMTP mail server. The
SMTP server can be an SMTP server located on your network or it can be the SMTP
server provided with Windows 2000. During the installation or upgrade procedure, you
must provide the name or IP address of the computer hosting the SMTP server.
 
If a valid SMTP server host name is not available during installation, supply an invalid
host name and the installation will finish. Do not leave the field blank. After installation,
add a valid SMTP server host name to the smtp_server attribute of the server config
object. Reinitialize the server after you update the server config object.
-----------------------------------
