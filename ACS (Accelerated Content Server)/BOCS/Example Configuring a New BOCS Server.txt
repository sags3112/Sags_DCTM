Example: Configuring a New BOCS Server


The BOCS communicates with the ACS running on the Content Server to fetch Content. The ACS must be up and running for the BOCS to work. The following procedure can be used to create a new BOCS and an associated Location object (for Sweden in this particular case). 



Create new Location Object for Sweden

Login to DA as dmadmin
Open Configuration > Network Locations
 File > New > Network Location 
Display Name: Sweden
Unique ID: sweden
Description: Swedish Offices
"at login time... ": Tick the box
IP Address Range - Click "Add" 
Enter the range of IP Address for client machines that will be associated with this location if required (see notes below)
When all the ranges have been added, click OK
Click OK
Create the new BOCS Configuration for Sweden, and associate a location object with the 

BOCS

Login to DA as dmadmin
Open Configuration > BOCS Servers
File > New > BOCS Config
Name: Sweden
Description: Swedish BOCS Server
Network Location: Sweden
Ability to read content; Read Content
Supported Protocols:
protocol: http
Base URL: http://<host>:8086/bocs/servlet/ACS
Click OK
Notes:

• Specifying an IP Address Range in the Network Location object is not mandatory, and can be omitted if required. If a users’ IP Address is not registered in any Network Location object, then the user will be prompted to select a Location at login time

• In this example, the Swedish Location object will be presented in the list of available locations on the Webtop login panel drop-down for users to select from. To remove Sweden from this list, untick the "at login time... ": box in the Network Location properties screen in DA

• Multiple location objects can be associated with a single BOCS Server. These can be configured when the BOCS Config object is created, or added later through DA.
