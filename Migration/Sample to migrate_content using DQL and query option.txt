

In order to migrate content from one filestore to another filestore you need to use the MIGRATE_CONTENT method 

Sample to migrate_content using DQL and query option

If you include a DQL predicate, the query built from the predicate is applied to DMR_CONTENT objects. It is recommended that you use a query that references a unique value in the content object. For example, the storage area ID there is only one storage area in the Docbase with any given storeage ID. 


Syntax: 


EXECUTE migrate_content WITH target_store=?target_storage_name?,query= 

?DQL_predicate?,log_file=?log_file_path? 

[,max_migrate_count=value][,batch_size=value] 

[,remove_original=value] 


apply,session,NULL,MIGRATE_CONTENT,TARGET_STORE,S,target_storage_name,QUERY,S,dql_predicate[,LOG_FILE,S,log_file_path][,MAX_MIGRATE_COUNT,I,value] [,BATCH_SIZE,I,value][,REMOVE_ORIGINAL,B,T|F] 


Sample: 


DQL> EXECUTE migrate_content WITH target_store='filestore_02', query='r_object_id=''0619978f8000877b''',max_migrate_count=1000, 

batch_size=100,log_file='C:\migration.log';
