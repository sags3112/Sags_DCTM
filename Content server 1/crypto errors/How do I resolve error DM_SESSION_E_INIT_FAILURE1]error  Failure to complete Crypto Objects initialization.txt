
How do I resolve error "DM_SESSION_E_INIT_FAILURE1]error:  Failure to complete Crypto Objects initialization.", when I start a remote 5.2 server that's part of a single Docbase multiple Server environment?
 
 
The aek file needs to be the same on all Server machines that are part of a single Docbase multiple Server environment. The aek file should be copied from the primary Server machine to all of the remote Server machines. 

1. Copy the AEK file from the primary/original site: 
$DOCUMENTUM/dba/secure/aek.key as 
$DOCUMENTUM/dba/secure/aek.key to secondary sites 

2. On the remote servers run the following command, do: 
A. cd %DM_HOME%\bin 
B. dm_encrypt_password -docbase <docbase name> -rdbms 
-encrypt <database password> 

3. Restart the remote server. 

NOTE: The aek.key file cannot be used across platforms. An AEK file created under Windows cannot be used on a UNIX system and vise-versa.
