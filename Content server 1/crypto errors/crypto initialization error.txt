When copying a Content Server installation to a new machine using Database utilities (for example, Oracle export and import), or installing additional Content Servers that share a single Docbase (for example, installing a Content Server on a second node in a cluster, installing a remote Content Server when using distributed content), follow these instructions. 

1. Copy the AEK file from the primary/original site: 

$DOCUMENTUM/dba/secure/aek.key as 
$DOCUMENTUM/dba/secure/aek.key to secondary sites 

2. On secondary system: 
cd $DM_HOME/bin 
dm_encrypt_password -docbase <docbase name> -rdbms -encrypt <database password>
