Cause

This is actually due to bug CS-3067.  The bug for CS-3067 is for a different problem where you cannot install the Content Server on an AMD Quad Core processor and it returns a different error.





However, if you installed the Content Server on a different processor and then moved the Content Server, through a VMWare image, to a host with an AMD Quad Core processor, you will have bypassed the original installation issue, but will see the errors from above when starting the repository.




Resolution

The bug fix for CS-3067 has been included in both SP1 and SP2 for Content Server 6.5.  Applying this patch will get you past this error and the repository will now start without error.
