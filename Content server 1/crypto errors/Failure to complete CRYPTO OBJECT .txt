9.)  In the docbase log do you see the following:  Failure to complete CRYPTO OBJECT initialization.

For a 5.2.5 docbase  - use SN 27127

For a 5.3 docbase - use  SN 74708

SN- 74708


	1. Shutdown all the docbase on the target server 

	2. Backup the database 

	3. Rename the aek.key file located under Documentum\dba\secure

	4. From SQL on the database: 
		update dm_docbase_config_s set i_crypto_key = ' ';   <--- single space
	5. From SQL: 
		select r_object_id from dmi_vstamp_s where i_application = 'dm_docbase_config_crypto_key_init'; 
	6. From SQL: 
		delete from dmi_object_type where r_object_id = 'returned r_object_id from above'; 
		commit; 
	7. From SQL: 
		delete from dmi_vstamp_s where r_object_id = 'returned r_object_id from step above' 
		commit; 
	8. From SQL: 
		update dm_docbase_config_s set i_ticket_crypto_key = ' ' (note empty space - one space between the quotes) 
		commit; 
	9. From SQL: 
		select r_object_id from dmi_vstamp_s where i_application = 'dm_docbase_config_ticket_crypto_key_init'; 
		 
	10. From SQL: 
		delete from dmi_object_type where r_object_id = '<id from above>' 
		commit; 
	11. From SQL: 
		delete from dmi_vstamp_s where r_object_id = 'id from above' 
		commit; 
	12. Run this file from $DM_HOME/bin: dm_crypto_create 

	13. To re-encrypt the dbpasswd.txt file do the following:

		open the dbpasswd.txt file from Documentum\dba\config\<docbasename>
		clear the document
		add your password (only the password)
		cd $DM_HOME/bin 

		run:
		%> dm_encrypt_password -docbase <docbase name> -rdbms -encrypt <database password> 

	14. You need to do all modification on the database for each docbase - BUT NOT step 11 - just do step 11 ONCE. 
	15. Startup the docbases.
