SOLUTION   
 
The error above may be due to a problem in the DMCL persistent cache. One instance where this error appeared may have been caused by an unexpeted crash of the client process. 
 

When the application was restarted, any query where the 'next' api returned NULL would cause the error to be thrown. There may be other ways in which the error could appear if there is a problem in the cache. 
 

Here is an example from the DMCL trace:

Resolution:

If this condition occurs, engineering believes that clearing the DMCL cache directories on the client application machine, then restarting the client process will correct the problem. Please see the referenced support note # 24004 for information clearing these caches.

What is dm_cache_config?
 
A cache config object identifies a group of queries, objects, or both to be cached on the client and refreshed at defined intervals. Type dm_cache_config is new to 5.2 server. This type is SysObject subtype and it is persistent and may not be versioned. 
 

It is created by applications to check coherency of objects and queries in groups. It is intended for objects and queries that change infrequently. It is also reduces server round trips by: 
 

- Checking a group of objects all once 
 
- Reduces the frequency of checks 
 
- Allows the server to make the checks asynchronously. 
 
 
 
Starting with 5.2 cache queries will be enabled by default. The cache_queries flag is still supported but if client_persistent_caching is false then cache query operations will be disabled regardless of the cache_queries setting. 
 

You may disable the cache query in the dmcl.ini file as follow: 
 

[DMAPI_CONFIGURATION] 
 
client_persistent_caching = F 
 

To remove items form the cache: 
 
- There is no interface provided to removed individual items from the cache therefore, objects in the cache can be removed in any of the following ways: 
 
- With the flush API call 
 
flush,c,persistentcache 
 
flush,c,persistentobjcache 
 
- By updating the dm_docbase_config.client_pcaching_change

Here's the summary for error:

 
- The error [DM_PLATFORM_E_INTEGER_CONVERSION_ERROR] may have been caused by some corruption in the cache.
- To clear the cache with API
             API>flushcache,c 
             API>flush,c,persistentcache 
             API>flush,c,persistentobjcache 
             API>flush,c,querycache 
 
Here's explanation from Content Server API Reference Manual 5.3 SP1 pages 213-217:
------------------------
Flushcache
 
Purpose Removes objects from the server and client in-memory caches. (It does not remove
objects from a persistent cache. Use Flush to remove objects from a persistent
cache.)
 
------------------------
Flush
 
Purpose Removes cached queries from the client’s query caches; ACLs or groups from the
session cache; objects from the persistent client caches; or non-persistent objects
from the data dictionary cache.
 

Flushing the persistent client cache

Flushing a persistent cache, or any part of it, flushes the cache for the user who executes
the Flush method. It is not possible to flush another user’s cache.
There are three options for flushing a persistent client cache. You can flush the entire
cache (objects and queries), only the objects in the cache, or only the query results. To
flush the entire cache, include the persistentcache keyword. To flush only the objects,
include the persistentobcache keyword. To flush only the query results, use the
querycache keyword .
If you flush the query cache files, the method removes all files from the cache file in the
user’s client local area and recreates the cache.map file without entries. (The cache.map
file maps the entries in an executed cached query to the results file.) The next time the
user executes a cached query, a new result set is cached.

------------------------
 

- To clear the cache on Application Server,
 Stop the Application Server
 Search for dmcl folder 
 Remove contents of dmcl folder (e.g. C:\Windows\System32\dmcl)
