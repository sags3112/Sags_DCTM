Disappearing CS and Docbroker from Server Manager

I had a hard disk issue this past week (bad sectors -all happy now) BUT now I am missing the docbase and docbroker entries from my server manager application.  How does Server manager determine the docbase and docbroker installed?


My docbase and docbroker service are up and running fine.  Just not accessible through server manager.




Server manager search docbase and docbroker from windows registry as following path

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Documentum\DOCBASES
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Documentum\DOCBROKERS

Maybe above entries is empty.
