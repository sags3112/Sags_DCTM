For some reason, I try to uninstall and reinstall Content Server and keep getting the below error: 


"Content server will not be installed. A more recent version already exists " 


There could be previous version(s) of Content Server installed on the CS machine. Make sure the vpd.properties file doesn't exist in C:\Windows directory or anywhere on the Content Server machine before you reinstall Content Server.
