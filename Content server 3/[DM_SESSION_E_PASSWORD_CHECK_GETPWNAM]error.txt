During the installation of the Content Server, after getting all of the input from the user, the installation process attempts to start the Docbase then run the scripts. The installation will not continue because it is waiting for the Docbase to start up. The user receives the message, "waiting docbase docbase_name to start up" with a progress bar and does not continue from there. Also the Content Server tries to login as the installed owner unsuccessfully in that step several times, which renders the installation owner's OS account to locked due to the many unsuccessful login attempts. 


This is an example of the error that's shown in the docbase log at the time:

This can occurs if the installation owner account does not have an operating system account on the same domain where the Content Server is being installed. 


The installation owner must have an operating system account on the same domain where the Content Server is being installed and must have the following user rights: 


* Act as part of the operating system 

* Create a token object 

* Increase quotas 

* Log on as a service 

* Log on locally 

* Replace a process-level token
