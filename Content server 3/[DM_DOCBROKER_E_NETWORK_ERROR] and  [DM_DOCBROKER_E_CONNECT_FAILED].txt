What can cause the errors [DM_DOCBROKER_E_NETWORK_ERROR] and  [DM_DOCBROKER_E_CONNECT_FAILED]

Resolution:

If the server log contains the following set of errors every five minutes: 


Fri Mar 02 10:22:14 2001 538000 [DM_DOCBROKER_E_NETWORK_ERROR]error: "An error occurred performing a network operation: (Unknown error code 112 (_nl_error_ = 10061)). Network specific error: (Winsock error: connection refused; server probably not running)." 

Fri Mar 02 10:22:14 2001 578000 [DM_DOCBROKER_E_CONNECT_FAILED]error: "Unable to connect to DocBroker. Please check your dmcl.ini file for a correct host. Network address: (INET_ADDR: family: 2, port: 1489, host: wwcs032 (172.16.73.102, ac104966))." 


The error message has to do with the server.ini file and the docbroker process, regardless of the suggestion of checking the dmcl.ini file. 


SOLUTION: 

1. Check server.ini file and found that one of the three projection target says: 

[DOCBROKER_PROJECTION_TARGET_2] 

host = wwcs032 


2. However, the docbroker on machine 'wwcs032' is down thus the above error about failing to connect to that docbroker on wwcs032. 


To resolve the problem, take either one of these two steps: 


1. Comment out the [DOCBROKER_PROJECTION_TARGET_2] host entry so that the server will stop trying to project to wwcs032, for example: 


[DOCBROKER_PROJECTION_TARGET_2] 

#host = wwcs032 


2. Or start up the docbroker on machine wwcs032 so that the server can connect to it successfully
