How to create separator log file per repository"



Resolution

If you have multiple repositories configured for a CTS instance, you can create separator log file per repository.

 

To do this

 

STEP1: Open log4j.properties under [Documentum]\config

STEP2: Look for “separatelogging” entry.

STEP3: Switching on separate logging by setting "separatelogging" to true.

(CTS will create a separate log file per repository.)

 

EX:

com.documentum.separatelogging.enabled=true.

 

STEP4: Stop the CTS service.

STEP5: Restart the CTS service.

STEP6: The CTS log file for each repository will be created (out of the box) under “[CTS home]\docbases\<docbasename>\config\logs” folder per repository.
