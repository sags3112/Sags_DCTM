THere is a known issue with the default install because of corrupted docapps with the installer. It's documented in the 6.1 release note.

CTS fails to start when con¿gured against the global
registry (150077)
CTS fails to start successfully when configured against a global registry and results in the
following error in the CTS_log.txt for all profiles:
com.documentum.cts.exceptions.internal.CTSProfileServiceException:
[DM_VEL_INSTANTIATION_ERROR]error: "Cannot instantiate Java class"
Cause Exception was: Exception during updating profile cache pdf_processing

The workaround is to manually run the Transformation and Rich_Media_Services
docapps against the global registry after configuring the CTS product.

Hi Shelly,

As per our  today's Telephonic discussion. I am just summarizing the conversation.

1) Check whether BOF Global Registry is configured correctly? If not Please follow the attached Document (how to enable global registry?)
2) Please stop the ADTS Service
3) Re-Run the Transformation and Rich_Media_Services Docapps
4) Stop/Start the CS Services
5) start the ADTS Service
