checked the Logs of the CTS and found error like :

[DM_VEL_INSTANTIATION_ERROR]error: "Cannot instantiate Java class"
Cause Exception was: Exception during updating profile cache pdf_processing


THere is a known issue with the default install because of corrupted docapps with the installer. It's documented in the 6.1 release note. 

CTS fails to start when con¿gured against the global registry (150077) CTS fails to start successfully when configured against a global registry and results in the
following error in the CTS_log.txt for all profiles:

Solution is like : The workaround is to manually run the Transformation and Rich_Media_Services


Still if you have problem of not rendering the documents:

check the log file.. after chekcing the log file found new error like 

aused by: DfException:: THREAD: Thread-10; MSG: [DFC_BOF_GLOBAL_REGISTRY_NOT_CONFIGURED] A global registry is not configured; ERRORCODE: ff; NEXT: null
	at com.documentum.fc.client.impl.bof.registry.GlobalModuleRegistry.lookup(GlobalModuleRegistry.java:54)

Solution:

Make sure the GR is active and configured correctly


Cause Exception was: Exception during updating profile cache merge_virtualdoc_adts
DfException:: THREAD: Thread-10; MSG: [DFC_BOF_CANNOT_FIND_OBJECT]  Business object com.documentum.services.dam.df.transform.ICTSService does not exist in docbase ; ERRORCODE: ff; NEXT: null

Solution :

if you recieve the above error.. check the version of ADTS and CS server.

Make sure that If ADTS6 is installed and configured to CS 6 sp1 but not the 5.3 version of CS.

Here Documentation is incorrect like 

if u install the ADTS 6 sp1 u have to configure the CS 6 sp1 not the 5.3 sp5

here the ADTS 6 sp1 tries to check the GR so if u have it its ok ! if not it throws the baove error.
