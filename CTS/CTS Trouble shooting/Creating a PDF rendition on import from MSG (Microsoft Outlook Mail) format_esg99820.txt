Creating a PDF rendition on import from MSG (Microsoft Outlook Mail) format


Symptoms

If you follow only the "Creating PDF renditions on import" section in the ADTS 6 Admin Guide (page 30) to configure MSG formats for automatic rendition on import, it will probably not work and the following error message can be seen in the CTS log:

"None of the sequence tasks were invoked as no valid profiles or matching formats were found."



Cause

Register.xml calls document_to_pdf.xml profile. In this profile, the format "msg" is not added out of the box.



Resolution

You should add following line in the 'Formats' section in the document_to_pdf.xml file:

<Format source="msg" target="pdf"/> 

Steps:
- Go to System\Media Server\System Profiles.
- Choose "Show all objects and versions" from the top right corner.
- Check out document_to_pdf.xml.
- Open the file in an editor.
- Add <Format source="msg" target="pdf" /> to the 'Formats' section where the other formats are listed.
- Save and close the file.
- Check in the file into the docbase.
- Restart Content Server and CTS server if needed.
- Import an msg file and the rendition should be created.
