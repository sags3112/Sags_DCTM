STEP 1: Stop the CTS service.
STEP 2: Rename the CTS "logs" folder and create a new logs folder.
 
By default the files are located under “[CTS home]\logs” folder.

STEP 3: Switch on debugging for CTS and all it’s media plug-ins, 
By default CTS is set to INFO Level in order to improve the performance.

Steps to change the log level:

1. Go to log4j.properties file under following folder DFC HOME config:
[DFC HOME]\config
usually “c:\documentum\config”

2. To get debug information for CTS, change the log level of " log4j.category.com.documentum.cts.impl " and “log4j.category.com.documentum.cts.services” appender to DEBUG

Ex:

FROM:
log4j.category.com.documentum.cts.impl=INFO, CTSServicesAppender
log4j.category.com.documentum.cts.services=INFO, CTSServicesAppender

TO:
log4j.category.com.documentum.cts.impl= DEBUG, CTSServicesAppender
log4j.category.com.documentum.cts.services= DEBUG, CTSServicesAppender

3. And for each Media Plug-in there is a separate entry.
For example in order to change Altercast Appender change "log4j.category.com.documentum.cts.plugin.altercast"
Ex:
log4j.category.com.documentum.cts.plugin.altercast=INFO, AltercastAppender

STEP 4: Make the transformation or the import request that is failing (while CTS is stopped).
STEP 5: Run the following DQL to get the queue items and attaché the result to the case.
DQL> select * from dm_queue where name = 'dm_mediaserver' or name = 'dm_autorender_win31';
STEP 6: Start CTS services.
STEP 7: Wait until CTS is initialized and start process the file.
STEP 8: Zip and attach all the log file files in the logs folder to the case.
STEP 9: Check the application event viewer for any error messages and attach.
