check how many you have in queue:

select count(*) from dmi_queue_item where name in ('dm_autorender_win31','dm_mediaserver')

 

If you have hundreds of thousands, let me know as we may want to do it through the database. If under 50,000 you should be ok to run by DQL

 

then to delete:

delete dmi_queue_item objects where  name = 'dm_mediaserver'

delete dmi_queue_item objects where  name = 'dm_autorender_win31'

 

select * from dm_queue where name= 'dm_autorender_win31' and name= 'dm_mediaserver'


select * from dm_queue_item where name= 'dm_mediaserver'
