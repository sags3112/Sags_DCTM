I am including two files

CTSServerScript.zip

CTSServerScript-replace.zip

 

Extract the contents of CTSServerScript.zip to Program Files\Documentum\CTS\docbases\<docbasename>

 

Then overwrite the extracted CTSServerScript.jar file with the one in the second zip named CTSServerScript-replace.zip

Then run the bat per the support note – check if paths need to be changed – this was written for when installed on C drive

 

 

Store the script, setDTSPass.bat in the folder: C:\Program Files\Documentum\CTS\docbases\mydocbase\CTSServerScript\bin

 

The CTSServerScript\bin folder does not exist, so it must be created.

 

====setDTSPass.bat:====

@echo off

"C:\PROGRA~1\DOCUME~1\java\1.5.0_12\bin\java" -classpath "C:\PROGRA~1\DOCUME~1\dctm.jar;C:\PROGRA~1\DOCUME~1\CTS\server_install\docbasename\CTSServerScript\lib\CTSServerScript.jar;C:\DOCUME~2\config" com.documentum.ctsscript.password.CTSPasswordUtil %*

To change the DTS Docbase user password:

======================

Log on to the MTS or XTS server and open a command window. 
Navigate to: C:\Program Files\Documentum\CTS\docbases\mydocbase\CTSServerScript\bin 
Run: setDTSPass.bat mydocbase <new password> 
Note: The procedure above assumes that DTS is installed in the default location, C:\Program Files\Documentum\CTS.  If DTS is not installed in this location, then the appropriate substitutions must be made in the procedure above.
