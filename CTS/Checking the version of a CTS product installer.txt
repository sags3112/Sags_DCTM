The following procedure allows you to check the version of a CTS installer (in this case,
the Advanced Document Transformation Services installer).

Navigate to the directory where the installer exists. Open a command prompt window.
Run the following command, using the full path to the Java executable on the machine,
if it is not defined as a system variable:

java -cp <installer_jar_file> DiShowVersion
For example, the full command for ADTS is: java -cp adtsWinSuiteSetup.jar
DiShowVersion.
This displays the full installer version.
