One of my customer has recently changed their installation owner account, following the guidelines in Content Server installation guide.
The previous installation owner account was dmadmin (local administrator), which is changed to dctm_services (domain administrator account) in domain 'exchange'.

Now, everything is working fine except for their custom java methods (deployed on method server) which uses a simple code for trusted login as shown below -


Resoution:


Can you check you service user and startMethodserver.cmd, and see whether it points to original dmadmin.


set NOPAUSE=true
set USER_MEM_ARGS=-Xms256m -Xmx256m -XX:PermSize=64m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -Xss256k -XX:+DisableExplicitGC -Xrs
set JAVA_OPTIONS=-Duser.name=dmadmin
E:\Documentum\jboss4.3.0\bin\run -c DctmServer_MethodServer -b 0.0.0.0 %JAVA_OPTIONS%
