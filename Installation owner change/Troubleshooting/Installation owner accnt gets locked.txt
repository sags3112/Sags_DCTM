Discussed various things that can cause problem 

1. dbpassword.txt file, run 

decrypttext,c,<info from dbpassword.txt file> 

If you are able to deencrpt the password then it is not a password file issue. 

2. Full text job 

3. WDK bug related to dmcl 

4. Any other job where there is wrong hardcoded password. 

5. If there is a custom wdk application 

If there is then you will need to set the following in dmcl.ini fielon the app server machine 

connect_retry_limit=1 

6. Also deactivate all jobs, documentum as custom application job and see what happens.
