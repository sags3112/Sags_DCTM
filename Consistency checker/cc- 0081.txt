CC-0080 and CC-0081 

How to resolve Warning CC-0081 from the Consistency Checker report


Symptoms

When running the Consistency Checker report, you may see the following error:




Checking for groups with disconnected super groups
  WARNING CC-0081: Group object with name '<group1>' has a supergroup '<group2>' that does not contain this group as a subgroup
  
Cause

The group reported still has a reference to the supergroup, but the supergroup no longer contains the reference to the subgroup.  The job runs the following query to indentify these groups: 


select a.r_object_id as p1, a.i_supergroups_names as p2 from dm_group_r a where a.i_supergroups_names is not NULL and a.i_supergroups_names <> ' ' and not exists " (select b.group_name from dm_group_s b where b.group_name = a.i_supergroups_names)



Resolution

Dump the <group1> group and check the i_supergroup_names attribute to see if the <group2> group is listed there.  Let's say <group2> is at position 1 of the attribute.  You can use the following API to remove the value:

API> remove,c,12xxxxxxxxxxxxxx,i_supergroups_names[1] 
... 
Ok 
API> save,c,12xxxxxxxxxxxxxx

You must repeat this for each group that was reported on
