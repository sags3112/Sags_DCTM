On an upgrade in place or coping a repository, there should be no need to delete an AEK key.

For copy a repository - you are copying it, from source to target.

Note: like platforms only, otherwise you do need to follow Sn to clear 

 

Try to delete the $DOCUMENTUM_SHARED/config/dfc.keystore first

This should resolve 90% of your issues.

 

If that does not work you can clear the entries in database listed in some of these support notes.

Note if you delete the aek key you will have to rebuild every encrypted password. (database, ldap , federation …)
