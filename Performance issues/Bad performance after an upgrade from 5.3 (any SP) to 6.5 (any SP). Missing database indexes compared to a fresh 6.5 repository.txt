Bad performance after an upgrade from 5.3 (any SP) to 6.5 (any SP). Missing database indexes compared to a fresh 6.5 repository. 
 


Symptoms

The performance seen from a standard client (Webtop/DA) has deteriorated after upgrading from version 5.3 to version 6.5.

 





Cause

Content Server upgrades are not creating the indexes required by the newer versions.  A fresh repository will contain new indexes that an upgrade does not create.

 

Resolution

Use the commands from the attached file to destroy and recreate the necessary indexes.

 

Some indexes name must be identified to drop them. Use the following SQL commands to identify the name to use (adapt <TABLE NAME IN UPPERCASE (_S or _R)>):

col column_position format 99 heading "POS"
col index_name format a24
col column_name format a24
break on index_name
select index_name, column_name, column_position
from user_ind_columns
where table_name = '<TABLE NAME IN UPPERCASE (_S or _R)>'
order by index_name, column_position;
clear col
clear break

The index_name will be returned back in UPPER CASE. 

Lower case should be used in the API DROP_INDEX command.
