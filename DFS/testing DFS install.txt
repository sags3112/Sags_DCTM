Unable to verify a successful DFS install.




Cause




The documentation to verify the install is not clear.




Resolution



Access the WSDL for various services that are installed as part of DFS. If the WSDL XMLis being properly served through a browser, the basic DFS install is working. For example, try the following URL after the install (substitute your host and port number below)



http://myhost:8888/services/core/QueryService"wsdl



(Note: For the above URL to work, replace the " with a question mark.) 





The above URL should work to confirm a successful basic installation. To confirm  docbase connectivity, please run one of the sample consumers provided with DFS SDK.
