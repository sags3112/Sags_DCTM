What is the password character limit in Documentum?  Does use of the Samba plugin change this limit?



Resolution

Documentum limits passwords to 256 characters.  However, if you are using the Samba/SMB plugin for authentication, then you will have a password limit of 14-16 characters.




Samba limits passwords to 14-16 characters for all CIFS authentication requests to accommodate limitations in NT4 and LanManager.  There is some discussion of increasing this, but this does not appear to have been implimented on the Samba side of things yet.
