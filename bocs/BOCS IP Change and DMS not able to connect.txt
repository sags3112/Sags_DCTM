The BOCS server was moved and was assigned a new IP address.Now all documents that are on the BOCS server are parked and unreachable by users when trying to access from the main content server. 



BOCS IP is changed, cause that bocs cannot connect to DMS
2) DMS keep send queue message to old bocs IP
3) recommend ct to install Aqua Data Studio tool to cleanup sybase DB
4) if ct want to move content manually, there is procedure  >select parent_id,r_object_id,content_attr_name,content_attr_value  from dmr_content   WHERE i_parked_state > 0 
now launch api>

retrieve,c,dm_document where r_object_id = 'xxx' 
fetch,c,l
setfile,c,c:\temp\xxx.tmp,pdf 
save,c,l
