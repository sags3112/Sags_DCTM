To turn on the Centera SDK tracing, set the following environment variable in the shell: 

setenv FPLIBRARY_LOG_FILE_DEBUG <full_path_of_output_file> 

or - Alternatively they can set the value in thier profile and then re-source that profile.


FPLIBRARY_LOG_FILE_DEBUG=<full_path_of_output_file> 
export FPLIBRARY_LOG_FILE_DEBUG 

Once the environment variable is set, restart the Content Server. 

This will not require a reboot.
