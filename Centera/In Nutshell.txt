To enable Centera on a docbase:




To enable Centera on a docbase, you first need to run the server configuration program to upgrade a docbase. One option is to enable Centera and you will need a license key to enable this.

Once this is complete, within DA, you can create a new storage object and point it to the address of your Centera. The address is defined in the storage parameters (a_storage_params and should be a comma separated list)

For example, if my Centera was on IPs 156.82.253.57 and 156.82.253.67, the value for the storage params would be:

156.82.253.57,156.82.253.67

If including a pea file, the format would be as follows:

 

156.82.253.57,156.82.253.67?/appl/dctm/dba/config/assap/assap_ecc_sbxs21_ca_store01.pea

 

Store the profile file in DOCUMENTUM/dba/config/repository_name/storage_object_name_centera_profile.pea,

Alternatively, use the CENTERA_PEA_LOCATION environment variable to enforce the use of access profiles. When the PEA file is created and copied to the application server, set the environment variable CENTERA_PEA_LOCATION to point to the PEA file.
