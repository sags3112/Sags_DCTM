How to create a multiple server / single repository for load balancing

Symptoms

Creating a multiple server / single repository for load balancing. There are various configurations documented pertaining to setting up a single server, setting up Distributed environments, and also a Cluster for failover. 


Cause

Old Documentation. 


Resolution

For a load balanced environment where you have multiple Content Servers and a single repository, the procedure to follow is documented in the Content Server installation guide under "Installing Remote Content-File Servers in Distributed Configurations".



Although the title is specific to Distributed, this also applies to the multi-server / single repository load balanced environment. This replaces an older procedure in the releases prior to 5.3 whereby the setup required manually creating a second server config object, creating a second install, and then running the configuration and ending at the headstart script.



This new procedure entails the following:

1. Installing the Content Server on the primary host.

2. Configuring the repository on the primary host

3. Installing Content Server on the second host

4. Running the CFSConfiguration utility on the second host. This utility creates the second server config object, copies over the necessary files such as aek.key, dmpassword.txt, server.ini, etc.



This process is also used for setting up a Distributed environment. So you can choose to setup a distributed storage location but it is not required for the load balanced portion. Instead, a single filestore can be shared between the two servers. Ensure that the installations of both primary and secondary servers are completed by a domain user account. A user account local to each server (even with the same name) are technically different accounts based on their uid. Using a domain account ensures access to the shared filestore location.
