Understanding projections and proximity values for multiple content server single repository


Resolution:


Understanding projections and proximity values for multiple content server single repository. Also known as Load Balancing
 
Examples using systemA and systemB
 
server.ini 
Note: any projection values will take a docbase restart.
**********************************************
server.ini for systemA:
[DOCBROKER_PROJECTION_TARGET]
host = systemA
port = 1457
   # blank or proximity=1, means local
 
[DOCBROKER_PROJECTION_TARGET_1]
host = systemB
port = 1489
proximity = 2  # Note it must be higher than 1 (for remote) and 9XXX is reserved for farstore
**********************************************
server.ini for systemB:
[DOCBROKER_PROJECTION_TARGET]
host=systemB
port=1457
 
[DOCBROKER_PROJECTION_TARGET_1]
host=systemA
port=1489
proximity=2 
 
Note: Using $DM_HOME/install/dm_launch_cfs_server_config_program.sh to install the second system will put in Farstore proximities. You will have to remove the 9xxx, since it not using farstore
 
Example:
[DOCBROKER_PROJECTION_TARGET]
host=systemB
port=1457
proximity=9001
[DOCBROKER_PROJECTION_TARGET_1]
host=systemA
port=1489
proximity=9002 
 
**********************************************
 
Server Config objects
Note: the server Config object will inherit the projections from server.ini 
So if it is wrong in server.ini, then it will take a docbase restart after it is fixed in server.ini file.
For changes in server config object use DA or iapi (DA is easier) So you can modify or drop and projection value.
 
********************************************** 
Server config object for systemA:
projection_targets      [0]: systemA
                        [1]: systemB
projection_ports        [0]: 1489
                        [1]: 1489
projection_proxval      [0]: 1
                        [1]: 2
********************************************** 
Server config object for systemB:
projection_targets      [0]: systemB
                        [1]: systemA
projection_ports        [0]: 1489
                        [1]: 1489
projection_proxval      [0]: 1
                        [1]: 2
**********************************************
 
dmcl.ini
Note: The dmcl.ini on the server is used only by the server as client.
So iapi or idql from command line on server and jobs
Now to run the jobs you must be on the local system, since it uses trusted logon.
Test the trusted logon by logging into system as install owner, using iapi, enter the docbase, then hitting <Carriage Return> for account and password.
 
From the server prospective the only value needed is for the local docbroker in the dmcl.ini
 
Here is a misconception, (Look at dmcl.ini and use the primary, then backup if primary is offline)
This is NOT true, both are used.
 
example:
Docbase docA, docB and docC project to docbroker systemA
Docbase docD, docE and docF project to docbroker systemA
 
So if there was pointing to docbroker on systemA; a docA, docB, docC, docD, docE and docF would be seen.
 
Now the Proximity value has more meaning for server projections since docbase name is the same.
So if there are 2 entries in dmcl.ini and the the proximity value is left blank in server.ini or server config object.
A job may point to the remote docbroker and try to authenticate there, but trusted login (authentication) will fail.
 
There has been sight of a configuration where there was no local projection value.
This will also fail, due to trusted login.
**********************************************
Here is a dmcl.ini have 2 listings:
[DOCBROKER_PRIMARY]
host = systemA
port = 1489
 
[DOCBROKER_BACKUP_1]
host=systemB
port=1489
