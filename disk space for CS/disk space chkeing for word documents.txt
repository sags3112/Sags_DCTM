Is there a way to calculate the disk space used by documents of a particular format for old (non-CURRENT) versions?

The following example illustrates how to determine the disk space used for Word 6 documents. To determine the disk space used for another format, replace 'msw6' with the full_format of the target document set. 


The following is a query that determines the disk space used by all documents of the format 'msw6' and that are marked CURRENT: 


select SUM(content_size) from dmr_content where full_format = 'msw6' and any parent_id_i in (select r_object_id_i from dm_document) 


To get all versions simply add the key word (all) after the select statement: 


select SUM(content_size) from dmr_content where full_format = 'msw6' and any parent_id_i in (select r_object_id_i from dm_document (all)) 


To derive the total disk space used by non-CURRENT versions, subtract the CURRENT number from the total for all versions.
