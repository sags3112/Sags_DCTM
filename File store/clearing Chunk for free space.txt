10:36 PMGolajana, SagarGood morning


10:37 PMDicks, Davidgood morning 


10:37 PMGolajana, SagarNeed help for 1 Vm image..
the size of the C drive is full  Windows Host: 128.222.105.52
is there any option to increase it


10:37 PMDicks, Davidoh, that sounds like east coast IP


10:37 PMGolajana, Sagarno idea
bob gave me
just 1 gb or 500 mb


10:38 PMDicks, Davidwest coast lab IPs are mostly in vLAN 726  10.8.26.xxx


10:38 PMGolajana, Sagaris fine to test
ok


10:38 PMDicks, DavidI have to check my notes to see if I have enough access to east coast vm labs... let me check


10:38 PMGolajana, Sagarok 
take ur time if u busy


10:40 PMDicks, Davidcannot connect via VSphere client


10:41 PMGolajana, Sagarok


10:41 PMDicks, Davidyou might ask Tony Qiu, he is the primary contact for that vm lab


10:41 PMGolajana, Sagarwil ask old man to do that 
lol 


10:41 PMDicks, Davidhehehe
are you able to login to the east coast VSphere client?
let me try another id


10:42 PMGolajana, Sagartony out
no 


10:43 PMDicks, David might be possible to bump up image size
otherwise common issue that files images are extracted installers


10:43 PMGolajana, Sagarhmm


10:43 PMDicks, Davidand if this is content server, number 1 issue is dm_logpurge is not running 


10:44 PMGolajana, Sagarlet me try that


10:44 PMDicks, Davidjust about every time I need to test on Solaris I have to clean up the host 


10:44 PMGolajana, Sagarhmm


10:45 PMDicks, Davidlogpurge really helps for older installs... I've cleared out over 300k logs for single user (dmadmin) for one docbase before.... for windows with what 4k sector size that's a big chunk of drive space


10:46 PMGolajana, Sagarrunning it


10:47 PMDicks, Davidanother common location for junk you can try to delete
%USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Temp


10:47 PMGolajana, Sagarok


10:47 PMDicks, Davidalso check
%windir%\Temp


10:47 PMGolajana, Sagarok


10:48 PMDicks, Davidand sometimes 
%windir%\PCHEALTH\ERRORREP\UserDumps
if still desparate for space there are some more tricks like deleting windows OS hot fix uninstallers... that will possibly get you 800MB or so if you windows updates are current
under %windir%, the uninstallers are all the directories in color prefixed wth '$'


10:50 PMGolajana, Sagargot some space now
3.95 Mb


10:50 PMDicks, Davidhehe
that is all? wow


10:50 PMGolajana, Sagarthnks david
it wrked


10:51 PMDicks, Daviddeleting Windows 2003 uninstallers on my desktop would reclaim about 1.1GB 


10:53 PMGolajana, Sagarohh
