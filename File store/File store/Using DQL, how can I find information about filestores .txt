The following DQL query statements will return information related to the storage of content. 

1) This DQL statement returns the actual file system path for a particular object's content: 
select file_system_path from dm_location where object_name in 
(select root from dm_filestore where name in 
(select a_storage_type from dm_document 
where r_object_id = '<r_object_id>')) 

2) This DQL statement returns the name of the filestore for a particular object's content: 
select a_storage_type from dm_sysobject 
where r_object_id = '<OID>' 

3) This DQL statement estimates how much disk space is used in a particular filestore: 
select sum(content_size) from dmr_content 
where storage_id in(select r_object_id 
from dm_store where name = '<file store name>') 

4) This DQL statement returns the name of the default file store for a particular type, "dm_document" for this example: 
select name from dm_store where r_object_id 
in(select default_storage from dmi_type_info 
where r_type_id in(select r_object_id 
from dm_type where name = 'dm_document')) 

5) This DQL statement returns the root directory the default file store for a particular type, dm_document for this example: 
select file_system_path from dm_location 
where object_name in(select root from dm_filestore 
where r_object_id in(select default_storage 
from dmi_type_info where r_type_id 
in(select r_object_id from dm_type 
where name = 'dm_document')))
