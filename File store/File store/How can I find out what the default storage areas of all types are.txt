How can I find out what the default storage areas of all types are?

The following select in the underlying RDBMS will give you a listing of types and their associated default storage locations. Note that subtypes of dm_sysobject will go in its default storage location and will not be listed unless you have altered the default storage of the type. 

Oracle: 

sqlplus docbasename 

>select dmi_type_info_s.r_type_name as type_name, dm_store_s.name as 
default_storage_name 
from dm_store_s, dmi_type_info_s 
where dmi_type_info_s.default_storage=dm_store_s.r_object_id; 

Sybase: 

isql -Udocbase username -Ppassword 
1> use db_solar30s 
2> go 
1> select dmi_type_info_s.r_type_name as type_name, dm_store_s.name as 
default_storage_name from dmi_type_info_s, dm_store_s where 
dmi_type_info_s.default_storage=dm_store_s.r_object_id 
2> go 


To alter the default storage of a type you can issue the following dql statement: 

alter type <type_name> set default storage '<storage_area_name>'
