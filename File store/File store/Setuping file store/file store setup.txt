
The question is:

“Regarding, the content migration, how they could set up a filestore that points to a \\server\share$\path location (instead to a drive letter path). And Is it supported to operate content server using content stores pointing to a CIFS server?”

I checked in the documentations for CIFS and found nothing, also checked for creating filestore and didn’t find anything related to this type of paths . Also checked CS-34734 but seems unrelated

Responding to your question: it should be fine.

Use this to create:
How can I create a dm_location and filestore using api?

Or this other one to modify:
How to setup a storage object to allow for UNC path

But beware of this other condition:
Can I install Content server with UNC path?
