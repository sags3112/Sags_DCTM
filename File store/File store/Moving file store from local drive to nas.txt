1st step

It does not work from DA so follow these steps from IAPI.
1. Create dm_location.
2. Create dm_filestore
3.set default storage of dm_sysobject/dm_document/custome_type to point to dm_store created in step2. This you can do from DA.
 
IApi Commands:
Create the dm_location object:

create,c,dm_location
set,c,l,object_name
loc_1_NAS
set,c,l,path_type
directory
set,c,l,file_system_path
//give the path here , check the dm_location object.
save,c,l


Create the dm_filestore object.
create,c,dm_filestore
set,c,l,name
store_1_NAS
set,c,l,root
store_1_NAS
set,c,l,crypto_mode
save,c,l


2nd step: Moving ƒOle store storage areas

You can move an entire file store storage area. For example, to reorganize your hardware,
you may need to move a storage area to a different disk.
Use the following procedure to move a file store storage area. 
The procedure describes how to move an entire storage area. It does not describe how to move individual files from one storage area to another.

To move a ƒOle store storage area:

1. Log in to the repository.
2. Set the storage area offline.
EXECUTE set_storage_state
WITH store = 'filestore_name', offline = TRUE
3. Copy the files in the storage area to the new location.
On Windows:
c:>copy /s /e source_directory target_directory
On UNIX:
264 EMC Documentum Content Server Version 6.5 Administration Guide
Content Management
% cp -r -p source_directory target_directory
where source_directory is the top-level directory in the current storage area and
target_directory is the new directory for the storage area. If the target directory does
not already exist when this command is issued, the command creates it and copies
the files and subdirectories into it from the source directory.
If the target directory does exist when this command is issued, the command copies
the source directory (and all files and subdirectories) into the target directory as a
subdirectory.
4. Set the file_system_path property of the dm_location object associated with the file
store object to point to the new directory for the storage area.
UPDATE "dm_location" OBJECT
SET "file_system_path" = new_directory_path
WHERE "object_name" = location_object_name
Note: In a file store object, the root property contains the object name of the location
object associated with the storage area.
5. Reinitialize the server and make the change visible.
6. Put the storage area back online:
EXECUTE set_storage_state
WITH store = 'filestore_name', offline = FALSE
You may remove the old storage area if you have no problems retrieving the contents
of documents from the new storage area.
