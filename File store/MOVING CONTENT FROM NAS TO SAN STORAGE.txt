Moving content ÉOles

Content Server supports three ways to move content files:
°E MIGRATE_CONTENT administration method
This method allows you to move one content file or multiple content files.
MIGRATE_CONTENT method is the recommended way to move multiple content
files if you do not have a Content Storage Services license and, consequently, cannot
use a content migration policy.
°E Content migration policies
Content migration policies are implemented as jobs. The jobs automate the
movement of content files from one storage area to another. A content migration
policy job invokes the MIGRATE_CONTENT method.
You must have installed Content Server with a Content Storage Services license to
use content migration policies.
°E Records migration jobs
A records migration job moves batches of content files based on criteria you define.
