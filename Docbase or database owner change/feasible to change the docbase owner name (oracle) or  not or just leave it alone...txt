Hi Shelley,

This is in Ref. to ticket no 21750058

Issue:

Question:  Is it feasible to change the data base owner name (oracle) or  not or just leave it alone..

Solution:

It is NOT advisable to change the docbase owner, the only way to do it is to do a full dump and load. 
(For instructions to do a Full Dump & Load please refer to the e-Content Server Administrator's Guide. Please note that the Docbase owner is also known as the Database Owner.)
If you want, you can check some of the customer forums for "change docbase owner" to see if anyone else was able to do it successfully.

Let me know if you have any concerns.
