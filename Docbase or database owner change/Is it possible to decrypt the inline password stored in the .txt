Symptoms

Is it possible to decrypt the inline password stored in the database?



Resolution

The encrypt and decrypt iapi command are not used for encrypting the user_password in the dm_user_s table.

WE did some research and found that the password cannot be decrypted. It is not possible. We use particular cryptographic algorithm for encryption. And it will not be possible for you to decrypt it by some command. 

It is a long complicated algorisms that we use and that depends upon a secret cryptographic key. We again perform a decryption algorithm for authentication purpose in our code.

 

In order not to have to reset the user password when you need to copy a repository you need to copy the aek.key from the source repository this is the supported procedure.
