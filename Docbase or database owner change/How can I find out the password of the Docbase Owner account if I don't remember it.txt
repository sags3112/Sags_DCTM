How can I find out the password of the Docbase Owner account if I don't remember it?


We store the Docbase Owner account password in the following file: 

$DOCUMENTUM/dba/config/<repository name>/dbpasswd.txt 

But the password will be encrypted. If you don't remember the password you can try the following to find out: 

- Open the file with any text editor and copy the contents 
Sample: 

DM_ENCR_TEXT=HuxIaMsV1mIQ7Y//FZsAFpqb0lJUaujRqAPekHED0LlOm5ysYKnlflw9+uqq+1my 

- Login into iapi as install owner (super user) 
- Issue the following API command: 

API> decrypttext,c,<encrypted password> 

Sample: 

API> decrypttext,c,DM_ENCR_TEXT=HuxIaMsV1mIQ7Y//FZsAFpqb0lJUaujRqAPekHED0LlOm5ysYKnlflw9+uqq+1my 
...
