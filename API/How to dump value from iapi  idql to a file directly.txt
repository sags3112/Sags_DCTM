How to dump value from iapi  idql to a file directly

Symptoms

You might want to dump a list of commands and results resulting from a dql using idql / iapi. This could be a required when you want to list a set of object ids for the fulltext re-indexing



Resolution

To achive this you can create two files (in the bin location)


commandfile.txt and result.txt file.



run the following from your CS bin folder (where you would have the iapi, idql exe)

bin> iapi32 <REPOSITORY> -U<USERNAME> -P<PASSWORD> -R<COMMANDFILE> > <RESULTFILE>



For example

bin>iapi32 reponame -Udmadmin -Ppassword -Riapifilecommand.txt > result.txt



(in the command file here i use api to run a dql) so i put:

?,c,select r_object_id from dm_message_archive



once it runs , check the result.txt

it should have logged the trace of the command and  result object id.

For more information check 
iapi32.exe -help
syntax: iapi32.exe <docbase> [-U<username>] [-P<password>] [-D<domain>] [-K<secure flag>] [-R<input file>] [-i|-I] [-v] [-l<log file>] [-Q] [-F<failure level>]
